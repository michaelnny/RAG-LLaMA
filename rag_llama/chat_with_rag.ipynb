      "According to the documentation provided, if your touchscreen is unresponsive or behaving unusually, you can try restarting it. To do this, please shift your vehicle into Park, hold down both scroll buttons on the steering wheel until the touchscreen turns black, and wait approximately 30 seconds for it to restart. If the issue persists after a few minutes, you can try power cycling the vehicle (if possible).\n",
