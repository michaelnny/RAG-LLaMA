While inside or near the vehicle, open the Tesla mobile app and touch Set Up Phone Key on the main screen, or navigate to Security > Set Up Phone Key. Follow the prompts on the mobile app and vehicle touchscreen to set up your phone key. To view a list of keys that can currently access Model S, or to remove a phone key, touch Controls > Locks (see Managing Keys on page 25). Model S can connect to three phone keys simultaneously. Therefore, if more than three phone keys are detected and you want to authenticate or pair a different phone, move the other connected phone key(s) out of range or turn off its Bluetooth setting. Once a phone has been authenticated, it no longer requires an internet connection to be used as a phone key for Model S. However, to use the phone hands-free, access your phone's contacts, play media from it, etc., you must also pair it and connect it as a Bluetooth device (see Bluetooth on page 57). Some smartphones with NFC capability can be used to lock/unlock your vehicle, just like using a key card. Ensure the Tesla mobile app is correctly paired to your vehicle and enable the NFC function on your phone. Once enabled, simply hold the phone to the driver's side door pillar to lock or unlock the door. Refer to your smartphone's instructions for specific information on how to do this.\n",

WARNING: Many unforeseen circumstances can impair Autopark's ability to park Model S. Keep this in mind and remember that as a result, Autopark may not steer Model S appropriately.

Summon allows you to automatically park and retrieve Model S while you are standing outside the vehicle. Summon moves Model S forward and reverse up to 39 ft.
