You must keep your hands on the steering yoke (or steering wheel) while Full Self-Driving (Beta) is engaged. In addition, the cabin camera monitors driver attentiveness (see Cabin Camera on page 20). Use Full Self-Driving (Beta) in limited Beta only if you will pay constant attention to the road and be prepared to act immediately, especially around blind corners, crossing intersections, and in narrow driving situations. For more information, see Limitations and Warnings on page 125.\n",
            "CAUTION: As Full Self-Driving (Beta) deployment expands, Tesla will gradually make it available to eligible customers in select countries outside of the United States and Canada. Because every country contains unique infrastructure, driving behaviors, and traffic patterns that Full Self-Driving (Beta) must adapt to over time, it is essential for drivers using Full Self-Driving (Beta) in newly eligible countries to be extra attentive and overly cautious. You must be ready to take over safely at any time. WARNING: Full Self-Driving (Beta) is a hands-on feature that requires you to pay attention to the road at all times. Keep your hands on the steering yoke (or steering wheel) at all times, be mindful of road conditions and surrounding traffic, pay attention to pedestrians and cyclists, and always be prepared to take immediate action. Failure to follow these instructions could cause damage, serious injury or death.

When Full Self-Driving (Beta) (also referred to as Autosteer on City Streets) is engaged, Model S attempts to drive to your destination by following curves in the road, stopping at and negotiating intersections, making left and right turns, navigating roundabouts, and entering/exiting highways. Unlike Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Autosteer, and Navigate on Autopilot, which are intended for use on multi-lane roadways with clear lane markings, Full Self-Driving (Beta) is meant to work in a variety of driving scenarios. You can use Full Self-Driving (Beta) on any type of roadway, including residential and city streets. Always remember that Full Self-Driving (Beta) does not make Model S autonomous and requires a fully attentive driver who is ready to take immediate action at all times. While Full Self-Driving (Beta) is engaged, you must monitor your surroundings and other road users at all times. Driver intervention may be required in certain situations, such as on narrow roads with oncoming cars, in construction zones, or while going through complex intersections. For more examples of scenarios in which driver intervention might be required, see Limitations and Warnings on page 125. Full Self-Driving (Beta) uses inputs from cameras mounted at the front, rear, left, and right of Model S to build a model of the area surrounding Model S (see Cameras on page 20). The Full Self-Driving computer installed in Model S is designed to use this input, rapidly process neural networks, and make decisions to safely guide you to your destination.

            "• Phone key - You can set up your personal phone as a \"phone key\" that communicate with Model S using Bluetooth. A phone key supports automatic locking and unlocking.\n",
            "• Key card - Tesla provides two key cards that communicates with Model S using short range radio-frequency identification (RFID) signals. The key card is used to \"authenticate\" phone keys to work with Model S and to add or remove other keys. Unlike the phone key and key fobs, the key card does not support automatic locking and unlocking. In situations where your phone key has a dead battery, or is lost or stolen, use your key card to unlock, drive, and lock Model S.\n",
            "• Key fob - The key fob (if equipped) allows you to press buttons to open the front and rear trunks, and unlock, lock, and drive Model S. The key fob also supports automatic locking and unlocking, if available in your region (see Walk-Away Door Lock on page 27Passive Locking and Unlocking on page 24) and can be used as a backup to your phone key.\n",
            "Model S supports a total of 19 keys, which can include phone keys, key cards, and up to four key fobs.\n",
            "CAUTION: Remember to bring a key with you when you drive. Although you can drive Model S away from its key, you will be unable to power it back on after it powers off.\n",

            "Content: Keep in mind that your phone must have enough battery power to run Bluetooth and that many phones disable Bluetooth when the battery is low. 4. While inside or near the vehicle, open the Tesla mobile app and touch Set Up Phone Key on the main screen, or navigate to Security > Set Up Phone Key. Follow the prompts on the mobile app and vehicle touchscreen to set up your phone key. To view a list of keys that can currently access Model S, or to remove a phone key, touch Controls > Locks (see Managing Keys on page 25). Model S can connect to three phone keys simultaneously. Therefore, if more than three phone keys are detected and you want to authenticate or pair a different phone, move the other connected phone key(s) out of range or turn off its Bluetooth setting. Once a phone has been authenticated, it no longer requires an internet connection to be used as a phone key for Model S. However, to use the phone hands-free, access your phone's contacts, play media from it, etc., you must also pair it and connect it as a Bluetooth device (see Bluetooth on page 57). Some smartphones with NFC capability can be used to lock/unlock your vehicle, just like using a key card. Ensure the Tesla mobile app is correctly paired to your vehicle and enable the NFC function on your phone. Once enabled, simply hold the phone to the driver's side door pillar to lock or unlock the door. Refer to your smartphone's instructions for specific information on how to do this.\n",

            "Content: NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, or date of manufacture, your vehicle may not come with a key fob. Go to http://shop.tesla.com for more information. You can quickly familiarize yourself with the key fob by thinking of it as a miniature version of Model S, with the Tesla badge representing the front. The key has buttons that feel like softer areas on the surface. 1. Rear trunk - Double-click to open or close the rear trunk. Hold down for one to two seconds to open the charge port door. 2. Lock/Unlock All - Single-click to lock doors and trunks (all doors and trunks must be closed). Double-click to unlock doors and trunks. 3. Front trunk - Double-click to unlatch the front trunk. Once inside, power up Model S by pressing the brake pedal within two minutes of pressing the unlock button on the key fob (see #unique_104 on page ). If you wait longer than two minutes, you must press the unlock button again, or place the key fob near the card reader located in the lower half of the left wireless phone charger, facing downward, on the center console. When your key fob is detected, the two minute authentication period restarts. When approaching or leaving Model S carrying the key fob, you do not need to point the key fob at Model S as you press a button, but you must be within operating range. Radio equipment on a similar frequency can affect the key. If this happens, move the key at least one foot (30 cm) away from other electronic devices (phones, laptops, etc.). In the event that the key fob's battery is dead, you can still use it.\n",

To initiate Autosteer, pull the Autopilot stalk toward you twice in quick succession. NOTE: If the setting for Autopilot Activation is set to Single Pull (touch Controls > Autopilot > Autopilot Activation), Autosteer engages when you pull the Autopilot stalk toward you once.

When Autosteer is able to detect lane markings, it also displays the driving lane in blue. Autosteer briefly displays a message on the instrument panel reminding you to pay attention to the road and be ready to take over at any time. The speed at which you can initiate Autosteer can vary depending on various conditions and whether or not a vehicle is detected ahead of you. When no vehicle is detected ahead of you, you must be driving at least 18 mph (30 km/h), unless certain vehicle and environmental conditions are met, in which case, you may be able to initiate it at lower speeds. When a vehicle is detected ahead of you, you can initiate Autosteer at any speed, even when stationary, provided Model S is at least 5 feet (150 cm) behind the detected vehicle. NOTE: When Autosteer is engaged, Auto High Beam is automatically enabled and the maximum cruising speed is 85 mph (140 km/h).
