When Full Self-Driving (Beta) (also referred to as Autosteer on City Streets) is engaged, Model S attempts to drive to your destination by following curves in the road, stopping at and negotiating intersections, making left and right turns, navigating roundabouts, and entering/exiting highways. Unlike Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Autosteer, and Navigate on Autopilot, which are intended for use on multi-lane roadways with clear lane markings, Full Self-Driving (Beta) is meant to work in a variety of driving scenarios. You can use Full Self-Driving (Beta) on any type of roadway, including residential and city streets. Always remember that Full Self-Driving (Beta) does not make Model S autonomous and requires a fully attentive driver who is ready to take immediate action at all times. While Full Self-Driving (Beta) is engaged, you must monitor your surroundings and other road users at all times. Driver intervention may be required in certain situations, such as on narrow roads with oncoming cars, in construction zones, or while going through complex intersections. For more examples of scenarios in which driver intervention might be required, see Limitations and Warnings on page 125. Full Self-Driving (Beta) uses inputs from cameras mounted at the front, rear, left, and right of Model S to build a model of the area surrounding Model S (see Cameras on page 20). The Full Self-Driving computer installed in Model S is designed to use this input, rapidly process neural networks, and make decisions to safely guide you to your destination.

To use a key card to unlock or lock Model S, position the card as shown and tap it against the card reader located approximately one third the way up of the driver's side door pillar. When Model S detects the key card, the exterior lights flash, the mirrors unfold or fold (if Fold Mirrors is on), the horn sounds (if Lock Confirmation Sound is on), and the doors unlock or lock.\n",
            "NOTE: You may need to physically touch the wireless phone charger or driver's side door pillar with the key card, and you may need to hold it against the transmitter for one or two seconds.\n",
            "Once inside, power up Model S by pressing the brake pedal within two minutes of scanning the key card (see Starting and Powering Off on page 65). If you wait longer than two minutes, you must re-authenticate by placing the key card near the card reader located in the wireless phone charger on the center console. When your key card is detected, your two minute authentication period restarts.\n",

            "Content: NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, or date of manufacture, your vehicle may not come with a key fob. Go to http://shop.tesla.com for more information. You can quickly familiarize yourself with the key fob by thinking of it as a miniature version of Model S, with the Tesla badge representing the front. The key has buttons that feel like softer areas on the surface. 1. Rear trunk - Double-click to open or close the rear trunk. Hold down for one to two seconds to open the charge port door. 2. Lock/Unlock All - Single-click to lock doors and trunks (all doors and trunks must be closed). Double-click to unlock doors and trunks. 3. Front trunk - Double-click to unlatch the front trunk. Once inside, power up Model S by pressing the brake pedal within two minutes of pressing the unlock button on the key fob (see #unique_104 on page ). If you wait longer than two minutes, you must press the unlock button again, or place the key fob near the card reader located in the lower half of the left wireless phone charger, facing downward, on the center console. When your key fob is detected, the two minute authentication period restarts. When approaching or leaving Model S carrying the key fob, you do not need to point the key fob at Model S as you press a button, but you must be within operating range. Radio equipment on a similar frequency can affect the key. If this happens, move the key at least one foot (30 cm) away from other electronic devices (phones, laptops, etc.). In the event that the key fob's battery is dead, you can still use it.\n",
