You may notice some loss of Infotainment functionality while the connection persists, but this alert does not indicate an issue with your vehicle. Your vehicle is OK to drive. What to do: This alert should clear automatically after the technician completes vehicle diagnosis or repair. You may find it necessary to restart your touchscreen to restore full Infotainment functionality after the alert has cleared. For more information, see Restarting the Touchscreen in your vehicle's Do It Yourself Guide. If this alert does not clear after 24 hours, it is recommended that you schedule service via your Tesla Mobile App or with an independent service provider.
