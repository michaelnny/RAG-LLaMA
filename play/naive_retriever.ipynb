            "◦ Touchscreen: Ensure Model S is in Park and touch the Dashcam icon in the app launcher. Videos are organized by timestamp. See Viewing Video Recordings on page 145 for more information. ◦ Computer: Insert the USB flash drive into a computer and navigate to the TeslaCam folder. Videos are organized by timestamp. See Viewing Video Recordings on page 145 for more information. 6. To turn Dashcam off, navigate to Controls > Dash cam > Off. If set to Auto, Manual, or On Honk, Dashcam automatically enables (but may not be actively saving footage, depending on your preferences) every time you drive. NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may not be equipped with Sentry Mode or the features may not operate exactly as described. It is your sole responsibility to consult and comply with all local regulations and property restrictions regarding the use of cameras. When enabled, your vehicle's cameras and sensors (if equipped) remain powered on and ready to record suspicious activity around your vehicle when Model S is locked and in Park. Think of Sentry Mode as an intelligent vehicle security system that alerts you when it detects possible threats nearby. If a threat is detected, Sentry Mode pulses the headlights, sounds the alarm, and displays a message on the touchscreen indicating that the cameras may be recording to inform individuals outside of the vehicle. The mobile app alerts you of the alarm and footage of the event is saved to USB drive (if installed). Sentry Mode is disabled by default. You can use voice commands or the Tesla mobile app to easily enable or disable Sentry Mode. To enable Sentry Mode using voice commands, say \"Keep Tesla safe,\" \"Keep my car safe,\" \"Sentry on,\" or \"Enable Sentry\" (see Voice Commands on page 18).

            "Content: Unlike Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Autosteer, and Navigate on Autopilot, which are intended for use on multi-lane roadways with clear lane markings, Full Self-Driving (Beta) is meant to work in a variety of driving scenarios. You can use Full Self-Driving (Beta) on any type of roadway, including residential and city streets. Always remember that Full Self-Driving (Beta) does not make Model S autonomous and requires a fully attentive driver who is ready to take immediate action at all times. While Full Self-Driving (Beta) is engaged, you must monitor your surroundings and other road users at all times. Driver intervention may be required in certain situations, such as on narrow roads with oncoming cars, in construction zones, or while going through complex intersections. For more examples of scenarios in which driver intervention might be required, see Limitations and Warnings on page 125. Full Self-Driving (Beta) uses inputs from cameras mounted at the front, rear, left, and right of Model S to build a model of the area surrounding Model S (see Cameras on page 20). The Full Self-Driving computer installed in Model S is designed to use this input, rapidly process neural networks, and make decisions to safely guide you to your destination. NOTE: Full Self-Driving (Beta) is a beta feature. As Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Beta) capabilities evolve, Model S is upgraded through over-the-air software updates. Download updates as soon as they become available. Like other Autopilot features, Full Self-Driving (Beta) requires a fully attentive driver and will display a series of escalating warnings requiring driver response. You must keep your hands on the steering yoke (or steering wheel) while Full Self-Driving (Beta) is engaged. In addition, the cabin camera monitors driver attentiveness (see Cabin Camera on page 20). Use Full Self-Driving (Beta) in limited Beta only if you will pay constant attention to the road and be prepared to act immediately, especially around blind corners, crossing intersections, and in narrow driving situations. For more information, see Limitations and Warnings on page 125.\n",

You must be ready to take over safely at any time. WARNING: Full Self-Driving (Beta) is a hands-on feature that requires you to pay attention to the road at all times. Keep your hands on the steering yoke (or steering wheel) at all times, be mindful of road conditions and surrounding traffic, pay attention to pedestrians and cyclists, and always be prepared to take immediate action.

NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may not be equipped with Summon, or the feature may not operate exactly as described. Summon allows you to automatically park and retrieve Model S while you are standing outside the vehicle. Summon moves Model S forward and reverse up to 39 ft. (12 meters) in, or out of, a parking space. To move Model S a longer distance while steering around objects, you can use Smart Summon (if equipped) and your mobile phone. Smart Summon allows your vehicle to find you (or you can send your vehicle to a chosen location). See Smart Summon on page 122. Summon requires that Model S can detect a valid key nearby. CAUTION: Ensure all cameras and sensors (if equipped) are clean. Dirty cameras and sensors, as well as environmental conditions such as rain and faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance. WARNING: Summon is designed and intended for use only on parking lots and driveways on private property where the surrounding area is familiar and predictable.\n",
