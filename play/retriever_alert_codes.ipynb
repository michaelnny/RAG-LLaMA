This alert is usually specific to external charging equipment and power sources and does not typically indicate an issue with your vehicle that can be resolved by scheduling service. What to do: Confirm whether the external charging equipment is powered by looking for any status lights, displays, or other indicators on the equipment. For more information on troubleshooting Mobile Connector or Wall Connector status lights, refer to the product's Owner's Manual at Charging & Adapter Product Guides. If the equipment is not powered, try to restore the external charging equipment’s power source.<br>• If attempting to charge at a public station and power is unable to be restored, contact the station operator.<br>• If attempting to charge at a private station (for example: charging at home) and power is unable to be restored, contact an electrician.<br>If the equipment is powered, try charging the vehicle using different external charging equipment.<br>• If the vehicle begins charging, the issue was likely with the equipment.<br>• If the vehicle still does not charge, the issue may be with the vehicle.<br>You can also try charging your vehicle using a Tesla Supercharger or Destination Charging location, all of which can be located through the map on your vehicle's touchscreen display.

Your vehicle is shutting down nonessential features to preserve energy for essential functions. If you are driving when this alert is present, it is possible your vehicle may shut down unexpectedly. It is also possible that your vehicle will not restart once parked. Nonessential features may be unavailable, including seat heaters, cabin climate control, and in-vehicle entertainment. This is expected behavior intended to help your vehicle maintain adequate electrical power for essential functions, including the ability to operate headlights, windows and doors, hazard lights, and the front trunk (frunk). It is possible your vehicle may lose all electrical power. If this occurs, you can still use the manual door releases to exit the vehicle if necessary. For more information, see Opening Doors from the Interior on page 27. What to do: This alert may be present due to various vehicle conditions.

This does not indicate an issue with your Mobile Connector or vehicle, but instead points to an issue with the wall outlet / electrical installation the Mobile Connector is connected to. A warm outlet may be caused by a plug that is not fully inserted, a loose building wiring connection to the outlet, or an outlet that is beginning to wear out. What to do: Make sure your adapter is fully plugged into the outlet. If charging speed does not return to normal, contact an electrician to inspect the outlet and building wiring connections to the outlet and complete any repairs needed. If the outlet is worn, it should be replaced with a high-quality outlet. Consider upgrading to a Tesla Wall Connector for greater convenience and highest charging speed.<br>Page: 268\n",

Your vehicle must maneuver with great precision when features like Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer are active. Before these features can be used for the first time, the cameras must complete an initial self-calibration. Occasionally, one or more cameras can become uncalibrated. What to do: Continue to your destination. Your vehicle is OK to drive. Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer will remain unavailable until camera calibration is complete. When calibration is complete, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer should be available. For your convenience, a calibration progress indicator is displayed on the touchscreen. Calibration typically completes after your vehicle has driven 20-25 miles (32-40 km), but the distance varies depending on road and environmental conditions. For example, driving on a straight road with highly visible lane markings helps the cameras calibrate quicker. If the alert persists and camera calibration has not completed after your vehicle has driven 100 miles (160 km) or more, or Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and Autosteer remain unavailable despite successful camera calibration, schedule service at your earliest convenience. Your vehicle is OK to drive in the meantime.<br>Page: 229 - 230\n",

You may notice that your vehicle's top speed is reduced and it responds slower than previously to acceleration requests. Your vehicle's maximum range may be reduced, and your vehicle may take longer to charge than before. Maximum charge rate varies, as always, based on location, power source, and charging equipment. Service is required to restore full performance. What to do: Your vehicle is OK to drive. It is recommended that you schedule service at your earliest opportunity. Without service, your vehicle may continue to show reduced power, acceleration, range, and charging performance. While this alert remains present, keep your vehicle charged to 30% capacity or higher to avoid any discrepancy between the estimated range displayed on your vehicle's touchscreen and the actual high voltage battery charge level.

Service is required to restore full performance. Your vehicle's maximum range may be reduced, and your vehicle may take longer to charge than before. Maximum charge rate varies, as always, based on location, power source, and charging equipment. What to do: Your vehicle is OK to drive. It is recommended that you schedule service at your earliest convenience. Without service, your vehicle may continue to show further reductions in maximum range and charging performance and may also begin to show reduced power and acceleration when driving. While this alert remains present, keep your vehicle charged to 30% capacity or higher to avoid any discrepancy between the estimated range displayed on your vehicle's touchscreen and the actual high voltage battery charge level.

The visualization automatically zooms in and out based on the detected road type. NOTE: Touch Controls > Autopilot > Full Self-Driving Visualization Preview (if equipped) to display more details about the roadway and its surroundings, such as road markings, stop lights, objects (such as trash cans and poles), etc. 1. The instrument panel displays your location on a map, a wiper menu, Auto Shift out of Park instructions, etc. When a navigation route is active, the upcoming portion of the route displays. 2. The speed limit (if available) that is currently being detected by Speed Assist (see Speed Assist on page 137). 3. Current driving speed. 4. The currently set cruising speed. When Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is available but you haven't set a cruising speed by engaging Traffic-Aware Cruise Control or Autosteer, the icon is gray (see Autopilot Features on page 100). 5. Autosteer is actively steering Model S. When Autosteer is available but you haven't activated it, the icon is gray (see Autosteer on page 101). 6. When navigating, upcoming instructions in the navigation route appear here. 7. Total estimated driving distance (or energy) available. Instead of driving distance, you can display the percentage of battery energy remaining (touch Controls > Display > Energy Display). NOTE: When anticipating when you need to charge, use estimates as a general guideline only. 8. Surrounding road users are shown in their corresponding locations. WARNING: Although the instrument panel shows surrounding traffic, some vehicles may not be displayed. Never rely on the instrument panel to determine if a vehicle is present (for example, in your blind spot).<br>Page: 17 - 18\n",
