If a threat is detected, Sentry Mode pulses the headlights, sounds the alarm, and displays a message on the touchscreen indicating that the cameras may be recording to inform individuals outside of the vehicle. The mobile app alerts you of the alarm and footage of the event is saved to USB drive (if installed). Sentry Mode is disabled by default.

To enable Sentry Mode using voice commands, say \"Keep Tesla safe,\" \"Keep my car safe,\" \"Sentry on,\" or \"Enable Sentry\" (see Voice Commands on page 17). Sentry Mode requires your Battery to be at least 20% charged. If the Battery falls below 20%, Sentry Mode turns off and the mobile app sends you a notification. Power consumption may increase when Sentry Mode is active. NOTE: When Sentry Mode is enabled, the Security Alarm settings ( Controls > Safety > Security Alarm) are not available. CAUTION: Do not rely on Sentry Mode to protect Model S from all possible security threats. Sentry Mode uses many factors to determine whether to activate the security alarm.

            "Content: As Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Beta) capabilities evolve, Model S is upgraded through over-the-air software updates. Download updates as soon as they become available. Like other Autopilot features, Full Self-Driving (Beta) requires a fully attentive driver and will display a series of escalating warnings requiring driver response. You must keep your hands on the steering yoke (or steering wheel) while Full Self-Driving (Beta) is engaged. In addition, the cabin camera monitors driver attentiveness (see Cabin Camera on page 20). Use Full Self-Driving (Beta) in limited Beta only if you will pay constant attention to the road and be prepared to act immediately, especially around blind corners, crossing intersections, and in narrow driving situations. For more information, see Limitations and Warnings on page 125.\n",

Because every country contains unique infrastructure, driving behaviors, and traffic patterns that Full Self-Driving (Beta) must adapt to over time, it is essential for drivers using Full Self-Driving (Beta) in newly eligible countries to be extra attentive and overly cautious. You must be ready to take over safely at any time. WARNING: Full Self-Driving (Beta) is a hands-on feature that requires you to pay attention to the road at all times. Keep your hands on the steering yoke (or steering wheel) at all times, be mindful of road conditions and surrounding traffic, pay attention to pedestrians and cyclists, and always be prepared to take immediate action. Failure to follow these instructions could cause damage, serious injury or death. It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the limitations of Full Self-Driving (Beta) and the situations in which it may not work as expected.\n",

You can quickly familiarize yourself with the key fob by thinking of it as a miniature version of Model S, with the Tesla badge representing the front. The key has buttons that feel like softer areas on the surface. 1. Rear trunk - Double-click to open or close the rear trunk. Hold down for one to two seconds to open the charge port door. 2. Lock/Unlock All - Single-click to lock doors and trunks (all doors and trunks must be closed). Double-click to unlock doors and trunks. 3. Front trunk - Double-click to unlatch the front trunk. Once inside, power up Model S by pressing the brake pedal within two minutes of pressing the unlock button on the key fob (see #unique_104 on page ). If you wait longer than two minutes, you must press the unlock button again, or place the key fob near the card reader located in the lower half of the left wireless phone charger, facing downward, on the center console. When your key fob is detected, the two minute authentication period restarts. When approaching or leaving Model S carrying the key fob, you do not need to point the key fob at Model S as you press a button, but you must be within operating range. Radio equipment on a similar frequency can affect the key. If this happens, move the key at least one foot (30 cm) away from other electronic devices (phones, laptops, etc.).

While inside or near the vehicle, open the Tesla mobile app and touch Set Up Phone Key on the main screen, or navigate to Security > Set Up Phone Key. Follow the prompts on the mobile app and vehicle touchscreen to set up your phone key. To view a list of keys that can currently access Model S, or to remove a phone key, touch Controls > Locks (see Managing Keys on page 25). Model S can connect to three phone keys simultaneously. Therefore, if more than three phone keys are detected and you want to authenticate or pair a different phone, move the other connected phone key(s) out of range or turn off its Bluetooth setting. Once a phone has been authenticated, it no longer requires an internet connection to be used as a phone key for Model S. However, to use the phone hands-free, access your phone's contacts, play media from it, etc., you must also pair it and connect it as a Bluetooth device (see Bluetooth on page 57). Some smartphones with NFC capability can be used to lock/unlock your vehicle, just like using a key card. Ensure the Tesla mobile app is correctly paired to your vehicle and enable the NFC function on your phone. Once enabled, simply hold the phone to the driver's side door pillar to lock or unlock the door. Refer to your smartphone's instructions for specific information on how to do this.\n",

WARNING: In addition, visibility is critical for Full Self-Driving (Beta) to operate. Low visibility, such as low light or poor weather conditions (rain, snow, direct sun, fog, etc.) can significantly degrade performance. WARNING: Model S may quickly and suddenly make unexpected maneuvers or mistakes that require immediate driver intervention. The list above represents only a fraction of the possible scenarios that can cause Full Self-Driving (Beta) to make sudden maneuvers and behave unexpectedly. In fact, Model S can suddenly swerve even when driving conditions appear normal and straight-forward. Stay alert and always pay attention to the roadway so you can anticipate the need to take corrective action as early as possible. Remember that this is an early access feature that must be used with extra caution. NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may not be equipped with Autopark. Autopark uses data to simplify parking on public roads by maneuvering Model S into parallel and perpendicular parking spaces. CAUTION: Ensure all cameras and sensors (if equipped) are clean.
