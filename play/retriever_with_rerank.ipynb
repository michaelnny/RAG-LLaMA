            "Content: WARNING: Always remember that Full Self-Driving (Beta) (also known as Autosteer on City Streets) does not make Model S autonomous and requires a fully attentive driver who is ready to take immediate action at all times. WARNING: Full Self-Driving (Beta) is a hands-on feature. Keep your hands on the steering yoke (or steering wheel) at all times, be mindful of road conditions and surrounding traffic, and always be prepared to take immediate action. Failure to follow these instructions could cause damage, serious injury or death. It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the limitations of Full Self-Driving (Beta) and the situations in which it may not work as expected. WARNING: Failure to follow all warnings and instructions can result in property damage, serious injury or death. CAUTION: Full Self-Driving (Beta) and its associated functions may not operate as intended and there are numerous situations in which driver intervention may be needed. Examples include (but are not limited to):\n",
            "• Interactions with pedestrians, bicyclists, and other road users. • Unprotected turns with high-speed cross traffic. • Multi-lane turns. • Simultaneous lane changes. • Narrow roads with oncoming cars or double-parked vehicles. • Rare objects such as trailers, ramps, cargo, open doors, etc. protruding from vehicles. • Merges onto high-traffic, high-speed roads. • Debris in the road. • Construction zones. • High curvature roads, particularly at fast driving speeds. Visibility is critical for Full Self-Driving (Beta) to operate. Low visibility, such as low light or poor weather conditions (rain, snow, direct sun, fog, etc.) can significantly degrade performance. WARNING: Model S may quickly and suddenly make unexpected maneuvers or mistakes that require immediate driver intervention. The list above represents only a fraction of the possible scenarios that can cause Full Self-Driving (Beta) to make sudden maneuvers and behave unexpectedly. In fact, Model S can suddenly swerve even when driving conditions appear normal and straight-forward. Stay alert and always pay attention to the roadway so you can anticipate the need to take corrective action as early as possible. Remember that this is an early access feature that must be used with extra caution. CAUTION: As Full Self-Driving (Beta) deployment expands, Tesla will gradually make it available to eligible customers in select countries outside the United States.\n",

            "Content: Unlike Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Autosteer, and Navigate on Autopilot, which are intended for use on multi-lane roadways with clear lane markings, Full Self-Driving (Beta) is meant to work in a variety of driving scenarios. You can use Full Self-Driving (Beta) on any type of roadway, including residential and city streets. Always remember that Full Self-Driving (Beta) does not make Model S autonomous and requires a fully attentive driver who is ready to take immediate action at all times. While Full Self-Driving (Beta) is engaged, you must monitor your surroundings and other road users at all times. Driver intervention may be required in certain situations, such as on narrow roads with oncoming cars, in construction zones, or while going through complex intersections. For more examples of scenarios in which driver intervention might be required, see Limitations and Warnings on page 125. Full Self-Driving (Beta) uses inputs from cameras mounted at the front, rear, left, and right of Model S to build a model of the area surrounding Model S (see Cameras on page 20). The Full Self-Driving computer installed in Model S is designed to use this input, rapidly process neural networks, and make decisions to safely guide you to your destination. NOTE: Full Self-Driving (Beta) is a beta feature. As Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Beta) capabilities evolve, Model S is upgraded through over-the-air software updates. Download updates as soon as they become available. Like other Autopilot features, Full Self-Driving (Beta) requires a fully attentive driver and will display a series of escalating warnings requiring driver response. You must keep your hands on the steering yoke (or steering wheel) while Full Self-Driving (Beta) is engaged. In addition, the cabin camera monitors driver attentiveness (see Cabin Camera on page 20). Use Full Self-Driving (Beta) in limited Beta only if you will pay constant attention to the road and be prepared to act immediately, especially around blind corners, crossing intersections, and in narrow driving situations. For more information, see Limitations and Warnings on page 125.\n",

            "Content: Model S supports the following types of keys:\n",
            "• Phone key - You can set up your personal phone as a \"phone key\" that communicate with Model S using Bluetooth. A phone key supports automatic locking and unlocking.\n",
            "• Key card - Tesla provides two key cards that communicates with Model S using short range radio-frequency identification (RFID) signals. The key card is used to \"authenticate\" phone keys to work with Model S and to add or remove other keys. Unlike the phone key and key fobs, the key card does not support automatic locking and unlocking. In situations where your phone key has a dead battery, or is lost or stolen, use your key card to unlock, drive, and lock Model S.\n",
            "• Key fob - The key fob (if equipped) allows you to press buttons to open the front and rear trunks, and unlock, lock, and drive Model S. The key fob also supports automatic locking and unlocking, if available in your region (see Walk-Away Door Lock on page 27Passive Locking and Unlocking on page 24) and can be used as a backup to your phone key.\n",
            "Model S supports a total of 19 keys, which can include phone keys, key cards, and up to four key fobs.\n",
            "CAUTION: Remember to bring a key with you when you drive. Although you can drive Model S away from its key, you will be unable to power it back on after it powers off.\n",

            "Content: NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, or date of manufacture, your vehicle may not come with a key fob. Go to http://shop.tesla.com for more information. You can quickly familiarize yourself with the key fob by thinking of it as a miniature version of Model S, with the Tesla badge representing the front. The key has buttons that feel like softer areas on the surface. 1. Rear trunk - Double-click to open or close the rear trunk. Hold down for one to two seconds to open the charge port door. 2. Lock/Unlock All - Single-click to lock doors and trunks (all doors and trunks must be closed). Double-click to unlock doors and trunks. 3. Front trunk - Double-click to unlatch the front trunk. Once inside, power up Model S by pressing the brake pedal within two minutes of pressing the unlock button on the key fob (see #unique_104 on page ). If you wait longer than two minutes, you must press the unlock button again, or place the key fob near the card reader located in the lower half of the left wireless phone charger, facing downward, on the center console. When your key fob is detected, the two minute authentication period restarts. When approaching or leaving Model S carrying the key fob, you do not need to point the key fob at Model S as you press a button, but you must be within operating range. Radio equipment on a similar frequency can affect the key. If this happens, move the key at least one foot (30 cm) away from other electronic devices (phones, laptops, etc.). In the event that the key fob's battery is dead, you can still use it. To unlock the vehicle, scan the key fob on the card reader located on the driver's side door pillar (like the key card). To drive the vehicle, scan the key fob on the phone charger. 1. Place it at the top of the left phone charger, against the center divider. 2. Point the front of the key fob down. 3. Swipe downwards.\n",

WARNING: The lists above do not represent every possible situation that may interfere with Lane Assist features. There are many reasons why Lane Assist may not operate as intended.

CAUTION: Ensure all cameras are clean and free of obstructions before each drive and before using Autopilot features (see Cleaning a Camera on page 182). Dirty cameras and sensors (if equipped), as well as environmental conditions such as rain and faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance.\n",
