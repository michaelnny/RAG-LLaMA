       "                 Great question! Enabling Autopilot on your Tesla Model S is a straightforward process that can be completed in a few easy steps. Here's how:<br>1. Check if your car is eligible: Autopilot is available on certain Tesla models, including the Model S. Check your car's software version to see if it's eligible for Autopilot. You can check your software version by going to the \"Settings\" menu on your car's touchscreen display.<br>2. Update your car's software: Make sure your car's software is up to date. Tesla regularly releases software updates that add new features, including Autopilot. You can check for updates by going to the \"Settings\" menu and selecting \"Software Update.\" If an update is available, follow the on-screen instructions to download and install it.<br>3. Enable Autopilot: Once your car's software is up to date, you can enable Autopilot. To do this, go to the \"Settings\" menu and select \"Autopilot.\" You'll see a message asking you to confirm that you want to enable Autopilot. Tap \"Enable\" to confirm.<br>4. Adjust the Autopilot settings: Once Autopilot is enabled, you can adjust the settings to your preference. You can do this by going to the \"Settings\" menu and selecting \"Autopilot.\" From here, you can adjust the following settings:<br>* Adaptive Cruise Control: This setting allows the car to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead of it.<br>* Lane Departure Warning: This setting alerts you if your car drifts out of its lane on the road.<br>* Automatic Emergency Braking: This setting allows the car to automatically apply the brakes in emergency situations.<br>* Traffic-Aware Cruise Control: This setting allows the car to adjust its speed based on traffic conditions.<br>5. Test the Autopilot features: Once you've enabled Autopilot and adjusted the settings, it's a good idea to test the features on the road. Start by activating the Adaptive Cruise Control and see how the car adjusts its speed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. Then, try out the Lane Departure Warning and Automatic Emergency Braking features by driving on a winding road or in heavy traffic.<br>That's it! With these steps, you should be able to enable Autopilot on your Tesla Model S. Remember to always follow the road rules and drive safely while using Autopilot.\n",

       "                 Thank you for reaching out to us! To enable Autopilot on your Tesla Model S, please follow these steps:<br>1. Make sure your phone is connected to the vehicle and has cellular service and GPS enabled.<br>2. Ensure that all cameras and sensors are clean and free from obstructions. Dirty cameras and sensors can affect Autopilot performance.<br>3. Park your vehicle in a safe location and ensure that all doors and trunks are closed.<br>4. Locate the Autopilot feature in the Controls menu and select Autopilot > Autopilot Features > Autosteer (Beta).<br>5. After carefully reading and understanding the popup window, touch Yes to enable Autosteer.<br>6. Autosteer will confirm activation with an audible chime and briefly display a message on the instrument cluster reminding you to pay attention to the road and be ready to take over at any time.<br>7. To indicate that Autosteer is now active, the instrument cluster will display the Autosteer icon in blue. When Autosteer is able to detect lane markings, it will display the edges of the driving lane in blue on the instrument cluster.<br>8. Autosteer will also activate Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, which will adjust your speed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.<br>9. If the speed limit cannot be detected when Autosteer is engaged, Autosteer will reduce your driving speed and limit the set cruising speed to 45 mph (70 km/h).<br>10. Although you can manually accelerate to exceed the limited speed, Model S will not brake for detected obstacles as long as you are applying the accelerator pedal. Autosteer will slow down to the limited speed when necessary.<br><br>I hope this helps!

       "                 Hello! As an assistant to the Tesla customer support team, I'd be happy to help answer your question.<br>To answer your question, it is generally not recommended to wash your Tesla car using regular car washing services. Tesla recommends using the Tesla Car Wash Kit, which is specifically designed for cleaning the unique features of Tesla vehicles. The kit includes a soft-bristle brush, a microfiber cloth, and a cleaning solution that is safe for the vehicle's paint and glass. Using regular car washing services may damage the vehicle's paint or compromise the functionality of the vehicle's sensors and systems.<br>According to the provided documents, Tesla recommends the following steps for cleaning the windshield washers:<br>* Use a thin strand of wire to clear any blockages from the nozzles if a windshield washer becomes blocked.<br>* Do not operate the washers while cleaning the vehicle. Windshield washer fluid can irritate eyes and skin.<br>For Model 3, Tesla recommends the following steps for cleaning the head or tail lights:<br>* If condensation accumulates in the exterior lenses, contact Tesla Service.<br>* Due to weather changes, humidity levels, or recent exposure to water (such as a car wash), condensation may occasionally accumulate in the vehicle's head or tail lights. This is normal, and the condensation often disappears on its own as the weather gets warmer and humidity decreases.<br><br>I hope this information helps! If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.<br><br>Reference documents:<br>MODEL S (2021 +) OWNER'S MANUAL Software version: 2024.2.3 North America - Jacking and Lifting - Cleaning Washer Jets - The position of the windshield washers is set at the factory and should never need adjusting. If a windshield washer becomes blocked, use a thin strand of wire to clear any blockages from the nozzles. WARNING: Do not operate the washers while cleaning Model S. Windshield washer fluid can irritate eyes and skin. Read and observe the washer fluid manufacturer’s instructions. Follow the steps below to lift Model S. Ensure that any non-Tesla repair facility is aware of these instructions, including lift points and warnings. 1. Position Model S centrally between the lift posts. 2. If your Model S is equipped with air suspension, it automatically self-levels, even when the vehicle is \"asleep\" and the touchscreen is powered off (see Jack Mode on page 198). Use the touchscreen to set the suspension as follows: ◦ Touch Controls > Suspension. ◦ Press the brake pedal, then touch Very High to maximize the height of the suspension. ◦ Touch Controls > Service > Jack Mode to disable self-leveling. 3. Position the lift arm pads under the designated body lift points at the locations shown. WARNING: DO NOT position the lift arm pads under the Battery or side rails. 4. Adjust the height and position of the lift arm pads to ensure that they are correctly located. 5. With assistance, raise the lift to the desired height, ensuring the lift arm pads remain in their correct positions. 6. Engage any lift safety locks. Follow the lift manufacturer's instructions. To disengage Jack Mode, disable it in Controls > Service. WARNING: The air suspension system automatically self-levels, even when the vehicle is \"asleep\" and the touchscreen is powered off. You MUST disable this system by<br><br>MODEL 3 (2024 ) OWNER'S MANUAL Software version: 2024.2.3 North America - Wipers and Washers - Condensation in Head or Tail Lights - Due to weather changes, humidity levels, or recent exposure to water (such as a car wash), condensation may occasionally accumulate in your vehicle’s head or tail lights.
