If Enable at Start of Every Trip is turned off, touch the Navigate on Autopilot button above the turn-by-turn directions to enable it. Once the Navigate on Autopilot is selected, it will engage whenever you engage Autosteer. The Navigate on Autopilot icon shows in the turn-by-turn direction list when you are navigating to a destination and Navigate on Autopilot is available but not active. If Navigate on Autopilot is active, the icon is blue. If Enable at Start of Every Trip is turned on, the Navigate on Autopilot icon is selected whenever you start navigation. Touch the icon to cancel Navigate on Autopilot and revert to Autosteer. Whenever Navigate on Autopilot is active, the Navigate on Autopilot button is blue and the instrument cluster displays the driving lane as a single blue line in front of Model S: The turn-by-turn directions display the Autosteer icon next to the maneuvers (such as off-ramps) that Navigate on Autopilot will handle. When Navigate on Autopilot is engaged Model S automatically makes both speed-based and route-based lane changes. • Speed Based Lane Changes: Navigate on Autopilot changes lanes to reduce driving time to your destination. For example, if Model S is behind a vehicle going below the set cruising speed, Navigate on Autopilot will move into the passing lane to pass it. Speed-based lanes changes are optional. • Route Based Lane Changes: Navigate on Autopilot changes lanes to route you to your destination. For example, Navigate on Autopilot will move into the exit lane as Model S approaches the off-ramp specified by the navigation route. If you ignore a route-based lane change suggestion (for example, you are driving in the left lane while approaching an off-ramp on the right side of the highway), Navigate on Autopilot is unable to maneuver onto the off-ramp and as a result, you are re-routed to your destination. NOTE: When determining navigation routes, and maneuvers at interchanges, Navigate on Autopilot considers whether or not you want to use High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes.\n",

       "                 Hello! As an assistant to the Tesla customer support team, I'm happy to help you with your question.<br>Full Self-Driving (FSD) on a Tesla vehicle is a advanced technology that allows for autonomous driving capabilities, but it's important to understand when it's not appropriate to use it. Here are some circumstances where you should not use FSD on your Tesla car:<br>1. In areas with limited or no visibility: FSD relies on a combination of cameras, radar, and ultrasonic sensors to navigate. If the area you are driving in has limited visibility due to weather conditions (e.g., heavy rain, snow, or fog), construction, or other factors, it may be difficult for the sensors to detect the environment around your vehicle. In such cases, it's best to use the vehicle's adaptive cruise control or manual driving mode.<br>2. In areas with complex traffic patterns: FSD is designed for straightforward driving scenarios on well-marked roads. However, in areas with complex traffic patterns, such as busy intersections, construction zones, or areas with multiple lanes merging, the technology may struggle to navigate safely. In these situations, it's better to take manual control of the vehicle.<br>3. In areas with pedestrian or cyclist activity: FSD is designed to detect and respond to pedestrians and cyclists, but in areas with high pedestrian or cyclist activity, it may be challenging for the technology to detect and respond to all potential hazards. It's important to be vigilant and take manual control of the vehicle in these situations.<br>4. In areas with road work or construction: FSD may not be able to handle unexpected road conditions, such as construction zones or road work. In these situations, it's best to use the vehicle's adaptive cruise control or manual driving mode.<br>5. In areas with heavy traffic: FSD may struggle to navigate in heavy traffic, especially if the traffic is unpredictable or there are multiple vehicles merging onto the same road. In these situations, it's better to take manual control of the vehicle.<br>6. In areas with low visibility due to vehicle size or shape: FSD may have difficulty detecting objects around your vehicle if it's oversized or undersized for the road, or if the vehicle has a unique shape that interferes with the sensors. In these situations, it's best to use the vehicle's adaptive cruise control or manual driving mode.<br>7. In areas with poor weather conditions: FSD may not perform well in extreme weather conditions, such as heavy rain, snow, or strong winds. In these situations, it's best to use the vehicle's adaptive cruise control or manual driving mode.<br>8. In areas with unmarked roadways: FSD relies on visual cues to navigate, so if the roadway is not well-marked, the technology may struggle to detect the road and navigate safely. In these situations, it's best to use the vehicle's adaptive cruise control or manual driving mode.<br>9. In areas with high crime rates: FSD may not be able to detect potential safety hazards, such as criminal activity, in areas with high crime rates. In these situations, it's best to take manual control of the vehicle and be vigilant of your surroundings.<br>10. In areas with unusual traffic patterns: FSD may not be able to handle unexpected traffic patterns, such as roundabouts or traffic circles, in areas where they are not well-marked or familiar to the driver. In these situations, it's best to use the vehicle's adaptive cruise control or manual driving mode.<br><br>By understanding these scenarios, you can use your Tesla vehicle's advanced technology safely and responsibly. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask!\n",

       "                 Based on the provided documents, there are several scenarios in which you should not use Full Self-Driving (Beta) on your Tesla car:<br>1. Narrow roads with oncoming cars or double-parked vehicles: Full Self-Driving (Beta) may have difficulty navigating through narrow roads with oncoming cars or double-parked vehicles, and driver intervention may be required in these situations.<br>2. Construction zones: Full Self-Driving (Beta) may not be able to navigate through construction zones, and driver intervention may be necessary to avoid obstacles and follow detour routes.<br>3. Debris in the road: If there is debris in the road, Full Self-Driving (Beta) may not be able to safely navigate around it, and driver intervention may be required.<br>4. Merges onto high-traffic, high-speed roads: Full Self-Driving (Beta) may not be able to safely merge onto high-traffic, high-speed roads, and driver intervention may be necessary to match the speed and trajectory of the traffic.<br>5. Rare objects such as trailers, ramps, cargo, open doors, etc. protruding from vehicles: Full Self-Driving (Beta) may not be able to detect and respond to rare objects protruding from vehicles, and driver intervention may be necessary to avoid collisions.<br>6. Low visibility conditions: Full Self-Driving (Beta) may not work effectively in low visibility conditions such as rain, snow, direct sun, fog, etc., and driver intervention may be necessary to safely navigate the road.<br>In summary, you should not use Full Self-Driving (Beta) in situations where driver intervention is necessary to ensure safe navigation, such as narrow roads, construction zones, debris in the road, merges onto high-traffic roads, rare objects protruding from vehicles, or low visibility conditions. It is important to always monitor the road and be prepared to take immediate action when necessary.<br><br>Reference documents:<br>Document title: MODEL S 2021 + OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2021 +<br>Software version: 2024.2.3<br>Subject: Limitations and Warnings<br>Section: Autosteer on City Streets (Full Self- Driving (Beta)) - part 1<br>Content: WARNING: Always remember that Full Self-Driving (Beta) (also known as Autosteer on City Streets) does not make Model S autonomous and requires a fully attentive driver who is ready to take immediate action at all times.

Keep your hands on the steering yoke (or steering wheel) at all times, be mindful of road conditions and surrounding traffic, and always be prepared to take immediate action. Failure to follow these instructions could cause damage, serious injury or death. It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the limitations of Full Self-Driving (Beta) and the situations in which it may not work as expected. WARNING: Failure to follow all warnings and instructions can result in property damage, serious injury or death. CAUTION: Full Self-Driving (Beta) and its associated functions may not operate as intended and there are numerous situations in which driver intervention may be needed. Examples include (but are not limited to):<br>• Interactions with pedestrians, bicyclists, and other road users. • Unprotected turns with high-speed cross traffic. • Multi-lane turns. • Simultaneous lane changes. • Narrow roads with oncoming cars or double-parked vehicles. • Rare objects such as trailers, ramps, cargo, open doors, etc. protruding from vehicles. • Merges onto high-traffic, high-speed roads. • Debris in the road. • Construction zones. • High curvature roads, particularly at fast driving speeds. Visibility is critical for Full Self-Driving (Beta) to operate. Low visibility, such as low light or poor weather conditions (rain, snow, direct sun, fog, etc.) can significantly degrade performance. WARNING: Model S may quickly and suddenly make unexpected maneuvers or mistakes that require immediate driver intervention. The list above represents only a fraction of the possible scenarios that can cause Full Self-Driving (Beta) to make sudden maneuvers and behave unexpectedly. In fact, Model S can suddenly swerve even when driving conditions appear normal and straight-forward. Stay alert and always pay attention to the roadway so you can anticipate the need to take corrective action as early as possible. Remember that this is an early access feature that must be used with extra caution. CAUTION: As Full Self-Driving (Beta) deployment expands, Tesla will gradually make it available to eligible customers in select countries outside the United States.<br><br>Document title: MODEL S 2021 + OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2021 +<br>Software version: 2024.2.3<br>Subject: Full Self-Driving (Beta)<br>Section: Limitations - part 2<br>Content: Unlike Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Autosteer, and Navigate on Autopilot, which are intended for use on multi-lane roadways with clear lane markings, Full Self-Driving (Beta) is meant to work in a variety of driving scenarios. You can use Full Self-Driving (Beta) on any type of roadway, including residential and city streets. Always remember that Full Self-Driving (Beta) does not make Model S autonomous and requires a fully attentive driver who is ready to take immediate action at all times. While Full Self-Driving (Beta) is engaged, you must monitor your surroundings and other road users at all times. Driver intervention may be required in certain situations, such as on narrow roads with oncoming cars, in construction zones, or while going through complex intersections. For more examples of scenarios in which driver intervention might be required, see Limitations and Warnings on page 125. Full Self-Driving (Beta) uses inputs from cameras mounted at the front, rear, left, and right of Model S to build a model of the area surrounding Model S (see Cameras on page 20). The Full Self-Driving computer installed in Model S is designed to use this input, rapidly process neural networks, and make decisions to safely guide you to your destination. NOTE: Full Self-Driving (Beta) is a beta feature. As Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Beta) capabilities evolve, Model S is upgraded through over-the-air software updates. Download updates as soon as they become available. Like other Autopilot features, Full Self-Driving (Beta) requires a fully attentive driver and will display a series of escalating warnings requiring driver response. You must keep your hands on the steering yoke (or steering wheel) while Full Self-Driving (Beta) is engaged. In addition, the cabin camera monitors driver attentiveness (see Cabin Camera on page 20). Use Full Self-Driving (Beta) in limited Beta only if you will pay constant attention to the road and be prepared to act immediately, especially around blind corners, crossing intersections, and in narrow driving situations. For more information, see Limitations and Warnings on page 125.<br>CAUTION: As Full Self-Driving (Beta) deployment expands, Tesla will gradually make it available to eligible customers in select countries outside of the United States and Canada.<br><br>Document title: MODEL S 2012–2020 OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2012–2020<br>Software version: 2024.2.3<br>Subject: Full Self-Driving (Beta)<br>Section: How to Use Full Self-Driving (Beta)<br>Content: To indicate that Full Self-Driving (Beta) is available but not engaged, the top corner of the touchscreen displays a gray steering wheel icon next to the driving gear. To engage Full-Self Driving (Beta), enter a destination (if desired) and pull the Autopilot stalk toward you twice in quick succession. If you do not enter a destination, Model S chooses the most probable driving path or suggests a destination based on your driving.<br>NOTE: If the setting for Autopilot Activation is set to Single Pull (touch Controls > Autopilot > Autopilot Activation), Autosteer engages when you pull the Autopilot stalk toward you once. While Full Self-Driving (Beta) is engaged:<br>1. The steering wheel icon next to the driving gear is blue and a blue line represents your driving path.<br>2. The instrument panel displays a visualization of the environment surrounding Model S, including the roadway and detected objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, curbs, etc.<br>3. Be ready to take over: There may be occasions where driver intervention is required and you must take over immediately to maintain safe driving. For example, the vehicle may alert you or the visualization may indicate indecisiveness by incessant flickering.<br>NOTE: Practicing a safe disengage before it is necessary is ideal. In addition, like Autosteer, Full Self-Driving (Beta) checks for driver attentiveness and requires your hands on the steering wheel at all times. If your hands are not detected, the instrument panel displays escalating warnings and failure to respond to these warnings cancels Full Self-Driving (Beta) until your next drive.<br>NOTE: Failure to use Full Self-Driving (Beta) appropriately may cause the feature to be disabled.<br>4. Safe disengage: To disengage Full Self-Driving (Beta) safely, be aware of your surroundings and push the Autopilot stalk away from you once, press the brake pedal, or take over and steer manually.<br>When arriving at a chosen destination, Full Self-Driving (Beta) stops Model S and displays a message indicating that navigation is complete.<br>NOTE: Full Self-Driving (Beta) uses Tesla's vision-based system and therefore radar (if equipped) is disabled.\n",

The touchscreen instructs you to stand in front of the vehicle, point the device's remote control at the front bumper, and press and hold the button until the headlights flash. When the headlights flash, Model S has learned the remote control and you can touch Continue on the touchscreen. If the headlights do not flash:<br>• Check the batteries in the remote control. It is a good idea to replace the batteries before you start programming.<br>• Ensure you are standing in front of Model S with the device's remote control positioned within two inches (five cm) of the Tesla emblem.<br>• Press and hold the button on your device's remote control until the headlights flash. In some cases you must hold the button on the remote control for up to three minutes.<br>NOTE: Some HomeLink remote controls require multiple short presses (approximately one second each press) instead of one long duration press. If you are unsuccessful after multiple attempts of using long presses, try repeated presses of one second each.\n",

       "                 Hello! As an assistant to the Tesla customer support team, I'm happy to help answer your question.<br>Great news! Tesla electric vehicles (EVs) don't require oil changes like traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. This is because Tesla EVs don't have internal combustion engines, which are the primary source of oil consumption. Instead, they have electric motors that are powered by rechargeable batteries.<br>So, you won't need to worry about changing the oil in your Tesla. However, it's important to keep your Tesla's battery healthy by following proper charging and maintenance practices. This includes keeping the battery terminals clean, avoiding extreme temperatures, and charging your vehicle regularly.<br>Additionally, it's worth noting that Tesla vehicles do have other maintenance requirements, such as rotating the tires and checking the brake pads. Your owner's manual will provide more information on these and other maintenance tasks.<br>I hope that helps! If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.\n",

       "                 Thank you for reaching out to us! Yes, you can wash your Tesla car using regular car washing services, but there are some precautions to take into consideration to ensure the safety and longevity of your vehicle.<br>According to the owner's manual, you should avoid washing your Tesla in direct sunlight, as it can cause damage to the paint and interior. Additionally, you should not use windshield treatment fluids, as they can interfere with the wiper friction and cause a chattering sound.<br>When using a pressure washer, make sure to maintain a distance of at least 12 inches between the nozzle and the surface of your Tesla. Avoid aiming the water jet directly at parking sensors, and keep the nozzle moving to avoid concentrating the water jet on any one area. Also, avoid using hot water, detergents, highly alkaline or caustic cleaning ingredients or solvents, as they can damage the paint and other components of your Tesla.<br>To avoid corrosive damage, make sure to rinse away any road salt from the underside of the vehicle, wheel wells, and brakes after cleaning. After cleaning the vehicle, dry the brakes by going on a short drive and applying the brakes multiple times.<br>It's also important to use the right cleaning cloths when washing your Tesla. Avoid using tight-napped or rough cloths, as they can scratch the paint. Instead, use a high-quality microfiber cleaning cloth.<br>If you're using an automatic car wash, make sure to use touchless car washes only. Some touchless car washes use caustic solutions that can cause discoloration of decorative exterior trim over time. Avoid exposure to soaps and chemicals above pH 13, and check the product label or ask the staff at the car wash if you're unsure.<br>Finally, ensure that the wipers are off before washing your Tesla to avoid damaging them. Also, avoid using chemical-based wheel cleaners or pre-wash products, as they can damage the finish on the wheels.<br>By following these precautions, you can safely wash your Tesla using regular car washing services.
