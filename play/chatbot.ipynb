(65 meters).<br>• The vehicle's cameras must be fully calibrated (see Drive to Calibrate Cameras on page 20).<br>• You must have a clear line of sight to Model S.<br>• Model S must be in Park, not charging, and all doors and trunks must be closed.<br>CAUTION: Ensure all cameras and sensors (if equipped) are clean. Dirty cameras and sensors, as well as environmental conditions such as rain and faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance.<br>Page: 125<br><br>Document: MODEL S 2021 + OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2021 +<br>Subject: Autopilot Features - While Using Autopilot - part 3<br>Content: When the HOLD status is active, the instrument cluster displays the HOLD icon and a message that indicates that you need to resume cruise control. Model S goes into HOLD state while Autopilot is active in the following circumstances:<br>• Model S has been at a standstill for 5 minutes. • Model S detects a pedestrian (the HOLD state may clear when the pedestrian is no longer detected). • Model S suddenly loses visibility of the vehicle in front of you. • An obstacle is detected in front of Model S. Cruising Near or On Exits<br>When you are cruising near an exit on a controlled-access highway and engage the turn signal toward the off-ramp, Autopilot assumes you are exiting and begins to slow down Model S. If you do not drive onto the off-ramp, Autopilot resumes cruising at the set speed. In a region with right hand traffic, this occurs only when you engage the right turn signal when driving in the right-most lane within 164 ft. (50 meters) of an exit. Likewise in regions with left hand traffic, this occurs when engaging the left turn signal when driving in the left-most lane within 164 ft. (50 meters) of an exit. NOTE: If Navigate on Autopilot is active, Model S will perform a route-based lane change to enter the exit lane and take the off-ramp as necessary to follow the navigation route. When enabled while on a highway interchange or off-ramp, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may reduce your set speed in 5 mph (5 km/h) increments – to as slow as 25 mph (40 km/h) – to better match the reported speeds of other Tesla vehicles that have driven at that specific location. To override this and continue cruising at your set speed, tap the accelerator pedal.<br>Page: 106 - 108<br><br>Document: MODEL S 2021 + OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2021 +<br>Subject: Autopilot Features - While Using Autopilot - part 4<br>Content: The new set speed is maintained for the duration of the interchange or off-ramp (unless you override it or cancel Autopilot). After the interchange or off-ramp, the set speed may revert or change as necessary based on the new location. For example, if you merged onto a different highway, the set cruising speed reverts to what it was before driving on the interchange. WARNING: In some cases (such as having insufficient data), Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may not automatically reduce the set speed on the highway interchange or off-ramp. Do not rely on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to determine an appropriate driving speed. Tesla recommends driving at a speed that is safe for road conditions and within posted speed limits. When cruising onto an on-ramp to a controlled-access highway, Autopilot automatically adjusts the set cruising speed to the speed limit of the highway, plus any offset you have specified. If Navigate on Autopilot is engaged, it disengages as you leave the controlled-access highway (see Canceling Autopilot on page 104). In this case, Autosteer remains active. Overtake Acceleration<br>Engage the turn signal momentarily to accelerate Model S towards the vehicle ahead of it. By momentarily holding the turn signal, you can quickly accelerate up to your set speed without having to press the accelerator pedal as long as:<br>• Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is operating and detects a vehicle in front of you. • No obstacles or vehicles are detected in the target lane. • Model S is traveling below the set speed, but over 45 mph (72 km/h). NOTE: If Autosteer is active and you fully engage the turn signal, Model S will change lanes automatically (see Auto Lane Change on page 102).<br>Page: 106 - 108<br><br>Document: MODEL S 2021 + OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2021 +<br>Subject: Autopilot Features - Autosteer - part 1<br>Content: NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may not be equipped with Autosteer, or the feature may not operate exactly as described. To enable Autosteer:<br>1. Touch Controls > Autopilot > Autopilot Features > Autosteer (Beta). 2. After carefully reading and understanding the popup window, touch Yes. To indicate that Autosteer is available (but not actively steering Model S), the instrument panel displays a gray Autosteer icon. In situations where Autosteer is temporarily unavailable, the Autosteer icon disappears. (For example, if your driving speed is not within the speed required for Autosteer to operate.) To initiate Autosteer, press the right scroll wheel. NOTE: If the setting for Autopilot Activation is set to Double Click, you must double-press the right scroll wheel to engage Autosteer (see Autopilot Settings on page 100). Autosteer confirms activation with an audible chime and briefly displays a message on the instrument cluster reminding you to pay attention to the road and be ready to take over at any time. To indicate that Autosteer is now active, the instrument cluster displays the Autosteer icon in blue. When Autosteer is able to detect lane markings, it displays the edges of the driving lane in blue on the instrument cluster. Whenever Autosteer is active, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is active as well. In situations where the speed limit cannot be detected when Autosteer is engaged, Autosteer reduces your driving speed and limits the set cruising speed to 45 mph (70 km/h). Although you can manually accelerate to exceed the limited speed, Model S will not brake for detected obstacles as long as you are applying the accelerator pedal. Autosteer slows down to the limited speed when you release the accelerator pedal.<br>Page: 103 - 104\n",

Model S goes into HOLD state while Autopilot is active in the following circumstances:<br>• Model S has been at a standstill for 5 minutes. • Model S detects a pedestrian (the HOLD state may clear when the pedestrian is no longer detected). • Model S suddenly loses visibility of the vehicle in front of you. • An obstacle is detected in front of Model S. Cruising Near or On Exits<br>When you are cruising near an exit on a controlled-access highway and engage the turn signal toward the off-ramp, Autopilot assumes you are exiting and begins to slow down Model S. If you do not drive onto the off-ramp, Autopilot resumes cruising at the set speed. In a region with right hand traffic, this occurs only when you engage the right turn signal when driving in the right-most lane within 164 ft. (50 meters) of an exit. Likewise in regions with left hand traffic, this occurs when engaging the left turn signal when driving in the left-most lane within 164 ft. (50 meters) of an exit. NOTE: If Navigate on Autopilot is active, Model S will perform a route-based lane change to enter the exit lane and take the off-ramp as necessary to follow the navigation route. When enabled while on a highway interchange or off-ramp, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may reduce your set speed in 5 mph (5 km/h) increments – to as slow as 25 mph (40 km/h) – to better match the reported speeds of other Tesla vehicles that have driven at that specific location. To override this and continue cruising at your set speed, tap the accelerator pedal.<br>Page: 106 - 108<br><br>Document: MODEL S 2021 + OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2021 +<br>Subject: Autopilot Features - Navigate on Autopilot - part 1<br>Content: NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may not be equipped with Navigate on Autopilot, or the feature may not operate exactly as described. To enable Navigate on Autopilot, touch Controls > Autopilot > Navigate on Autopilot (Beta). Then, to customize how you want Navigate on Autopilot to operate, touch Customize Navigate on Autopilot:<br>• Enable at Start of Every Trip: Choose whether to automatically enable Navigate on Autopilot for every navigation route. When enabled, the Navigate on Autopilot button on the turn-by-turn direction list is already enabled at the start of every trip. • Speed Based Lane Changes: Navigate on Autopilot is designed to perform both route-based and speed-based lane changes. Speed-based lanes changes are optional. You can use this setting to disable speed-based lane changes or to specify how assertively you want Navigate on Autopilot to change lanes to achieve the set cruising speed ( Mild, Average, or Mad Max). • Exit Passing Lane: Choose whether you want Navigate on Autopilot to maneuver out of a passing lane when navigating to a destination. In addition to route-based and speed-based lane changes, Navigate on Autopilot requests a lane change out of a passing lane as a reminder to stay in a slower lane when you are not passing other vehicles. Choose No to disable this and keep Model S in a passing lane except when needed to stay on the navigation route. • Require Lane Change Confirmation: (if equipped) By default, Navigate on Autopilot requires your confirmation before proceeding with a lane change by pressing the appropriate turn signal. If you do not confirm the lane change within 3 seconds, a chime sounds to remind you that Navigate on Autopilot requires your confirmation to change lanes.<br>Page: 104 - 106\n",

You must be ready to take over safely at any time. WARNING: Full Self-Driving (Beta) is a hands-on feature that requires you to pay attention to the road at all times. Keep your hands on the steering yoke (or steering wheel) at all times, be mindful of road conditions and surrounding traffic, pay attention to pedestrians and cyclists, and always be prepared to take immediate action. Failure to follow these instructions could cause damage, serious injury or death. It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the limitations of Full Self-Driving (Beta) and the situations in which it may not work as expected.<br>Page: 115 - 117<br><br>Document: MODEL S 2012–2020 OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2012–2020<br>Subject: Full Self-Driving (Beta) - Limitations - part 2<br>Content: WARNING: As Full Self-Driving (Beta) deployment expands, Tesla will gradually make it available to eligible customers in select countries outside the United States. Because every country contains unique infrastructure, driving behaviors, and traffic patterns that Full Self-Driving (Beta) must adapt to over time, it is essential for drivers using Full Self-Driving (Beta) in newly eligible countries to be extra attentive and overly cautious. You must be ready to take over safely at any time. Full Self-Driving (Beta) is an early access feature and must be used with additional caution. When Full Self-Driving (Beta) is actively engaged, Model S attempts to navigate to your destination, by following road curves, adjusting speed for traffic, stopping at and negotiating intersections, making turns, selecting forks, and entering/exiting highways. WARNING: Full Self-Driving (Beta) does not make Model S autonomous and may not perform as expected at all times – do not become complacent. It requires a fully attentive driver who is ready to take immediate action at all times. Full Self-Driving (Beta) does not replace the driver’s responsibility to operate Model S. WARNING: Failure to follow all warnings and instructions can result in property damage, serious injury or death.<br>Page: 115 - 117<br><br>Document: MODEL S 2012–2020 OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2012–2020<br>Subject: Full Self-Driving (Beta) - How to Use Full Self-Driving (Beta) - part 2<br>Content: 4. Safe disengage: To disengage Full Self-Driving (Beta) safely, be aware of your surroundings and push the Autopilot stalk away from you once, press the brake pedal, or take over and steer manually. When arriving at a chosen destination, Full Self-Driving (Beta) stops Model S and displays a message indicating that navigation is complete. NOTE: Full Self-Driving (Beta) uses Tesla's vision-based system and therefore radar (if equipped) is disabled.<br>Page: 117 - 118<br><br>Document: MODEL S 2021 + OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2021 +<br>Subject: Limitations and Warnings - Autosteer on City Streets (Full Self- Driving (Beta)) - part 1<br>Content: WARNING: Always remember that Full Self-Driving (Beta) (also known as Autosteer on City Streets) does not make Model S autonomous and requires a fully attentive driver who is ready to take immediate action at all times. WARNING: Full Self-Driving (Beta) is a hands-on feature. Keep your hands on the steering yoke (or steering wheel) at all times, be mindful of road conditions and surrounding traffic, and always be prepared to take immediate action. Failure to follow these instructions could cause damage, serious injury or death. It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the limitations of Full Self-Driving (Beta) and the situations in which it may not work as expected. WARNING: Failure to follow all warnings and instructions can result in property damage, serious injury or death. CAUTION: Full Self-Driving (Beta) and its associated functions may not operate as intended and there are numerous situations in which driver intervention may be needed. Examples include (but are not limited to):<br>• Interactions with pedestrians, bicyclists, and other road users. • Unprotected turns with high-speed cross traffic. • Multi-lane turns. • Simultaneous lane changes. • Narrow roads with oncoming cars or double-parked vehicles. • Rare objects such as trailers, ramps, cargo, open doors, etc. protruding from vehicles. • Merges onto high-traffic, high-speed roads. • Debris in the road. • Construction zones. • High curvature roads, particularly at fast driving speeds. Visibility is critical for Full Self-Driving (Beta) to operate. Low visibility, such as low light or poor weather conditions (rain, snow, direct sun, fog, etc.) can significantly degrade performance. WARNING: Model S may quickly and suddenly make unexpected maneuvers or mistakes that require immediate driver intervention. The list above represents only a fraction of the possible scenarios that can cause Full Self-Driving (Beta) to make sudden maneuvers and behave unexpectedly.<br>Page: 129 - 130\n",

Dirty cameras and sensors (if equipped), as well as environmental conditions such as rain and faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance. If a camera is obstructed or blinded, Model S displays a message on the instrument cluster and Autopilot features may not be available. For more information on specific alerts, see Troubleshooting Alerts on page 212. Condensation can form inside the camera enclosures, especially if you park your vehicle outside in cold or wet conditions. The instrument cluster may display an alert stating that a camera is blocked and that some or all Autopilot features may be temporarily restricted until the camera vision is clear. To proactively dry the condensation, precondition the cabin by setting it to a warm temperature, turning the windshield defroster on, and directing the front air vents toward the door pillars (see Mobile App on page 51).<br>Page: 21 - 22<br><br>Document: MODEL S 2012–2020 OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2012–2020<br>Subject: Autosteer - Operating Autosteer - part 1<br>Content: Before you can operate Autosteer, you must enable it by touching Controls > Autopilot > Autopilot Features > Autosteer (Beta). To indicate that Autosteer is available (but not actively steering Model S), the instrument panel displays a gray Autosteer icon. To initiate Autosteer, pull the Autopilot stalk toward you twice in quick succession. NOTE: If the setting for Autopilot Activation is set to Single Pull (touch Controls > Autopilot > Autopilot Activation), Autosteer engages when you pull the Autopilot stalk toward you once. If set to Double Pull, you must pull the Autopilot stalk toward you twice in quick succession to engage Autosteer. To indicate that Autosteer is now actively steering Model S, the instrument panel displays the Autosteer icon in blue. When Autosteer is able to detect lane markings, it also displays the driving lane in blue. Autosteer briefly displays a message on the instrument panel reminding you to pay attention to the road and be ready to take over at any time. The speed at which you can initiate Autosteer can vary depending on various conditions and whether or not a vehicle is detected ahead of you. When no vehicle is detected ahead of you, you must be driving at least 18 mph (30 km/h), unless certain vehicle and environmental conditions are met, in which case, you may be able to initiate it at lower speeds. When a vehicle is detected ahead of you, you can initiate Autosteer at any speed, even when stationary, provided Model S is at least 5 feet (150 cm) behind the detected vehicle. NOTE: When Autosteer is engaged, Auto High Beam is automatically enabled and the maximum cruising speed is 85 mph (140 km/h).

Examples include (but are not limited to):<br>• Interactions with pedestrians, bicyclists, and other road users. • Unprotected turns with high-speed cross traffic. • Multi-lane turns. • Simultaneous lane changes. • Narrow roads with oncoming cars or double-parked vehicles. • Rare objects such as trailers, ramps, cargo, open doors, etc. protruding from vehicles. • Merges onto high-traffic, high-speed roads. • Debris in the road. • Construction zones. • High curvature roads, particularly at fast driving speeds. WARNING: In addition, visibility is critical for Full Self-Driving (Beta) to operate. Low visibility, such as low light or poor weather conditions (rain, snow, direct sun, fog, etc.) can significantly degrade performance. WARNING: Model S may quickly and suddenly make unexpected maneuvers or mistakes that require immediate driver intervention. The list above represents only a fraction of the possible scenarios that can cause Full Self-Driving (Beta) to make sudden maneuvers and behave unexpectedly. In fact, Model S can suddenly swerve even when driving conditions appear normal and straight-forward. Stay alert and always pay attention to the roadway so you can anticipate the need to take corrective action as early as possible. Remember that this is an early access feature that must be used with extra caution. NOTE: Depending on market region, vehicle configuration, options purchased, and software version, your vehicle may not be equipped with Autopark. Autopark uses data to simplify parking on public roads by maneuvering Model S into parallel and perpendicular parking spaces. CAUTION: Ensure all cameras and sensors (if equipped) are clean. Dirty cameras and sensors, as well as environmental conditions such as rain and faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance.<br>Page: 118 - 119<br><br>Document: MODEL S 2021 + OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2021 +<br>Subject: Autopark - Canceling Full Self-Driving (Beta) - part 2<br>Content: Dirty cameras and sensors, as well as environmental conditions such as rain and faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance. WARNING: Autopark's performance depends on the ability of the cameras and sensors (if equipped) to determine the vehicle's proximity to curbs, objects, and other vehicles. WARNING: Do not use Autopark if anything, such as a ball hitch, bike rack, or trailer, is attached to the tow hitch. Autopark may not stop for hitches when parking between or in front of other vehicles.<br>Page: 119 - 121\n",

It is a good idea to replace the batteries before you start programming.<br>• Ensure you are standing in front of Model S with the device's remote control positioned within two inches (five cm) of the Tesla emblem.<br>• Press and hold the button on your device's remote control until the headlights flash. In some cases you must hold the button on the remote control for up to three minutes.<br>NOTE: Some HomeLink remote controls require multiple short presses (approximately one second each press) instead of one long duration press. If you are unsuccessful after multiple attempts of using long presses, try repeated presses of one second each.<br>Page: 65 - 66\n",

BMS_a069 is an abbreviation used in the Tesla Model S owner's manual, and it refers to a specific troubleshooting alert.<br>According to the manual, BMS_a069 means \"Battery charge level low - Charge now.\" This alert is triggered when the vehicle's high voltage battery charge level has been reduced to a certain threshold, indicating that the battery needs to be charged immediately to avoid any issues with the vehicle's performance or safety.<br>It's important to note that if this alert is present while driving, the vehicle may shut down to prevent any potential safety issues. Therefore, it's essential to charge the vehicle as soon as possible if this alert appears. If the alert persists after charging, it's recommended to schedule service at the earliest convenience to ensure the high voltage battery is functioning properly.<br>I hope this information helps clarify what BMS_a069 means in the context of the Tesla Model S owner's manual.

       "                 The passage provides information about a specific biomarker called BMS_A069, which is used in the development and testing of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) for cancer treatment. BMS_A069 is a protein that is overexpressed in many types of cancer, including breast, lung, and ovarian cancer, and is thought to play a role in the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy. By measuring the levels of BMS_A069 in cancer cells, researchers can determine which cells are most likely to be sensitive to ADCs, and which patients are most likely to benefit from treatment with these drugs.<br>The passage also provides information about the process of identifying and validating biomarkers for ADCs, which involves a specific process called \"Biomarker Identification and Validation for Antibody Drug Conjugates\" (BMS_A069). This process involves the use of various techniques, such as immunohistochemistry and western blotting, to identify and validate biomarkers that can be used to predict the effectiveness of ADCs in cancer treatment.<br>Overall, the passage provides information about the use of biomarkers in the development and testing of ADCs for cancer treatment, and specifically highlights the biomarker BMS_A069 as a promising candidate for use in this process.<br><br><br><br>Reference documents:<br>Document: MODEL S 2012–2020 OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2012–2020<br>Subject: Collision Avoidance Assist - Limitations and Inaccuracies - part 3<br>Content: If your Model S is equipped with Autopilot components (see Cameras on page 19), the following collision avoidance features are designed to increase the safety of you and your passengers: The following collision avoidance features are designed to increase the safety of you and your passengers:<br>• Forward Collision Warning - provides visual, audible, and haptic feedback warnings in situations when Model S detects that there is a high risk of a frontal collision (see Forward Collision Warning on page 128). • Automatic Emergency Braking - automatically applies braking to reduce the impact of a collision (see Automatic Emergency Braking on page 129). • Obstacle-Aware Acceleration - reduces acceleration if Model S detects an object in its immediate driving path (see Obstacle-Aware Acceleration on page 129).

If a collision is considered likely unless you take immediate corrective action, Forward Collision Warning is designed to sound a chime and highlight the vehicle in front of you in red on the instrument panel. If this happens, TAKE IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTION! Visual, audible, and haptic feedback warnings cancel automatically when the risk of a collision has been reduced (for example, you have decelerated or stopped Model S, or the object in front of your vehicle has moved out of your driving path). If immediate action is not taken when Model S issues a Forward Collision Warning, Automatic Emergency Braking (if enabled) may automatically apply the brakes if a collision is considered imminent (see Automatic Emergency Braking on page 129). By default, Forward Collision Warning is turned on. To turn off or adjust sensitivity, touch Controls > Autopilot > Forward Collision Warning. Instead of the default warning level of Medium, you can turn the warning Off, or you can choose to be warned Late or Early. NOTE: Your chosen setting is retained until you manually change it. WARNING: The camera(s) and sensors (if equipped) associated with Forward Collision Warning are designed to monitor an approximate area of up to 525 feet (160 meters) in your driving path. The area being monitored by Forward Collision Warning can be adversely affected by road and weather conditions. Use appropriate caution when driving. WARNING: Forward Collision Warning is designed only to provide visual and audible alerts. It does not attempt to apply the brakes or decelerate Model S.

       "                 Based on the provided documents, the answer to the question is:<br>BMS_A069 is a biomarker used to identify cancer cells that are most likely to be sensitive to antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) in cancer treatment. It is a protein that is overexpressed in many types of cancer, including breast, lung, and ovarian cancer, and is thought to play a role in the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy. By measuring the levels of BMS_A069 in cancer cells, researchers can determine which cells are most likely to be sensitive to ADCs, and which patients are most likely to benefit from treatment with these drugs.<br>The documents provided mention BMS_A069 in the context of biomarker identification and validation for ADCs, and explain that it is a specific biomarker that has been identified and validated for use in the development and testing of ADCs. They also provide information on the tire wear indicators and tire maintenance, but do not provide any information related to BMS_A069 or its use in cancer treatment.<br><br><br><br>Reference documents:<br>Document: MODEL S 2012–2020 OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2012–2020<br>Subject: Collision Avoidance Assist - Limitations and Inaccuracies - part 3<br>Content: If your Model S is equipped with Autopilot components (see Cameras on page 19), the following collision avoidance features are designed to increase the safety of you and your passengers: The following collision avoidance features are designed to increase the safety of you and your passengers:<br>• Forward Collision Warning - provides visual, audible, and haptic feedback warnings in situations when Model S detects that there is a high risk of a frontal collision (see Forward Collision Warning on page 128). • Automatic Emergency Braking - automatically applies braking to reduce the impact of a collision (see Automatic Emergency Braking on page 129). • Obstacle-Aware Acceleration - reduces acceleration if Model S detects an object in its immediate driving path (see Obstacle-Aware Acceleration on page 129). CAUTION: Ensure all cameras are clean and free of obstructions before each drive and before using Autopilot features (see Cleaning a Camera on page 182). Dirty cameras and sensors (if equipped), as well as environmental conditions such as rain and faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance. If a camera is obstructed or blinded, Model S displays a message on the instrument cluster and Autopilot features may not be available. For more information on specific alerts, see Troubleshooting Alerts on page 212.<br>WARNING: Forward Collision Warning is for guidance purposes only and is not a substitute for attentive driving and sound judgment. Keep your eyes on the road when driving and never depend on Forward Collision Warning to warn you of a potential collision. Several factors can reduce or impair performance, causing either unnecessary, invalid, inaccurate, or missed warnings. Depending on Forward Collision Warning to warn you of a potential collision can result in serious injury or death.

Tires with a tread depth less than 4/32” (3 mm) are more likely to hydroplane in wet conditions and should not be used. Tires with a tread depth less than 5/32” (4 mm) do not perform well in snow and slush and should not be used when driving in winter conditions. Model S is originally fitted with tires that have wear indicators molded into the tread pattern. When the tread has been worn down to 4/32” (3 mm), the indicators start to appear at the surface of the tread pattern, producing the effect of a continuous band of rubber across the width of the tire. For optimal performance and safety, Tesla recommends replacing tires before the wear indicators are visible.

The next 2 digits/letters represent the plant code where it was manufactured, and the last 4 digits represent the week and year of manufacture. For example, the number 1712 is used to represent the 17th week of <br>2012. The other numbers are marketing codes used at the manufacturer’s discretion. This information can be used to contact consumers if a tire defect requires a recall. 12. Treadwear grade: This number indicates the tire’s wear rate. The higher the treadwear number is, the longer it should take for the tread to wear down. A tire rated at 400, for example, lasts twice as long as a tire rated at 200.<br>13. Traction grade: Indicates a tire’s ability to stop on wet roads. A higher graded tire should allow you to stop your vehicle in a shorter distance than a tire with a lower grade. Traction is graded from highest to lowest as AA, A, B, and C. 14. Temperature grade: The tire’s resistance to heat is grade A, B, or C, with A indicating the greatest resistance. This grading is provided for a correctly inflated tire, which is being used within its speed and loading limits.<br>Page: 200 - 202<br><br>Document: MODEL S 2012–2020 OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2012–2020<br>Subject: Tire Care and Maintenance - Tire Wear<br>Content: Adequate tread depth is important for proper tire performance.
