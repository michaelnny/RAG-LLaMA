       "                 Hello! I'm happy to help you with your question. Enabling Autopilot on a Tesla Model S 2018 model is a straightforward process. Here are the steps you can follow:<br>1. Make sure your Tesla is equipped with the necessary hardware for Autopilot. The Model S 2018 comes with the necessary hardware, but it's important to check to ensure that it's properly installed and functioning. You can check the Autopilot settings in the Tesla app or by using the vehicle's touchscreen display.<br>2. Ensure that your Tesla is in a safe location and that you are in a legal driving position. Autopilot should only be enabled in a safe and legal manner.<br>3. Press the Autopilot button on the steering wheel or use the voice command \"Autopilot on\" to enable the feature. Once enabled, the Autopilot icon will appear on the instrument cluster and the vehicle will begin to perform autonomous driving functions.<br>4. Adjust the Autopilot settings to your preference. You can do this by using the touchscreen display or by using the Autopilot settings menu in the Tesla app.<br>5. Start driving and enjoy the benefits of Autopilot! Autopilot will take control of the vehicle's acceleration, steering, and braking, allowing you to focus on other tasks while driving.<br>It's important to note that Autopilot is a Level 2 autonomous driving system, which means it requires the driver's attention and participation at all times. The driver must always be ready to take control of the vehicle and must be aware of their surroundings.<br>I hope this helps! If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.\n",

       "                 Thank you for reaching out to us! To enable Autopilot on your Tesla Model S 2018 model, please follow these steps:<br>1. Make sure your vehicle is equipped with the necessary hardware and software for Autopilot. This includes having the Full Self-Driving (Beta) software update installed and the Autopilot feature enabled in your vehicle's settings.<br>2. Locate the Autopilot stalk on the center console of your vehicle. This is the small lever next to the gear selector.<br>3. Pull the Autopilot stalk toward you twice in quick succession to engage Autosteer. You will know Autosteer is active when the instrument panel displays a blue Autosteer icon.<br>4. If you want to enable Navigate on Autopilot, touch the Navigate on Autopilot button above the turn-by-turn directions on the instrument panel. This will engage the feature and allow Model S to make both speed-based and route-based lane changes.<br><br>Please note that Autopilot and Navigate on Autopilot are beta features and may not work perfectly in all situations. It's important to always pay attention to the road and be ready to take over the vehicle at any time. If you have any questions or concerns about Autopilot or Navigate on Autopilot, feel free to ask!<br><br>Reference documents:<br>Document title: MODEL S 2012–2020 OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2012–2020<br>Software version: 2024.2.3<br>Subject: Full Self-Driving (Beta)<br>Section: Tips<br>Content: • Fullscreen visualization: You can widen the visualization area to fullscreen. First enable the setting by touching Controls > Autopilot > Full Self-Driving > Expanded Full Self-Driving Visualization.<br>• Feedback: If you experience incorrect or unexpected behavior, touch the snapshot icon (if equipped) at the top of the touchscreen to send data to Tesla for analysis. Tesla uses this data to improve the intelligence of Full Self-Driving (Beta).<br>• Maintain software updates and cameras: Always remember that Full Self-Driving (Beta) does not make Model S autonomous. Full autonomy is dependent on achieving reliability far in excess of human drivers as demonstrated by billions of miles of experience, as well as regulatory approval. As Tesla’s Full Self-Driving capabilities evolve, Model S is continuously upgraded through over-the-air software updates. Download updates as soon as they become available. To ensure an optimum experience, keep all cameras clean and unobstructed.<br><br>Document title: MODEL S 2021 + OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2021 +<br>Software version: 2024.2.3<br>Subject: Smart Summon<br>Section: Before Using Smart Summon<br>Content: • Download the latest version of the Tesla mobile app to your phone, and ensure your phone has cellular service and GPS enabled.<br>• Your phone must be connected to Model S and located within approximately 213 ft. (65 meters).<br>• The vehicle's cameras must be fully calibrated (see Drive to Calibrate Cameras on page 20).<br>• You must have a clear line of sight to Model S.<br>• Model S must be in Park, not charging, and all doors and trunks must be closed.<br>CAUTION: Ensure all cameras and sensors (if equipped) are clean. Dirty cameras and sensors, as well as environmental conditions such as rain and faded lane markings, can affect Autopilot performance.<br><br>Document title: MODEL S 2021 + OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2021 +<br>Software version: 2024.2.3<br>Subject: Autopilot Features<br>Section: Navigate on Autopilot - part 2<br>Content: Once enabled, the Navigate on Autopilot button appears on the map’s turn-by-turn direction list whenever a navigation route is active and the route includes at least one controlled-access highway. If Enable at Start of Every Trip is turned off, touch the Navigate on Autopilot button above the turn-by-turn directions to enable it. Once the Navigate on Autopilot is selected, it will engage whenever you engage Autosteer. The Navigate on Autopilot icon shows in the turn-by-turn direction list when you are navigating to a destination and Navigate on Autopilot is available but not active. If Navigate on Autopilot is active, the icon is blue. If Enable at Start of Every Trip is turned on, the Navigate on Autopilot icon is selected whenever you start navigation. Touch the icon to cancel Navigate on Autopilot and revert to Autosteer. Whenever Navigate on Autopilot is active, the Navigate on Autopilot button is blue and the instrument cluster displays the driving lane as a single blue line in front of Model S: The turn-by-turn directions display the Autosteer icon next to the maneuvers (such as off-ramps) that Navigate on Autopilot will handle. When Navigate on Autopilot is engaged Model S automatically makes both speed-based and route-based lane changes. • Speed Based Lane Changes: Navigate on Autopilot changes lanes to reduce driving time to your destination. For example, if Model S is behind a vehicle going below the set cruising speed, Navigate on Autopilot will move into the passing lane to pass it. Speed-based lanes changes are optional. • Route Based Lane Changes: Navigate on Autopilot changes lanes to route you to your destination. For example, Navigate on Autopilot will move into the exit lane as Model S approaches the off-ramp specified by the navigation route. If you ignore a route-based lane change suggestion (for example, you are driving in the left lane while approaching an off-ramp on the right side of the highway), Navigate on Autopilot is unable to maneuver onto the off-ramp and as a result, you are re-routed to your destination. NOTE: When determining navigation routes, and maneuvers at interchanges, Navigate on Autopilot considers whether or not you want to use High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes.<br><br>Document title: MODEL S 2012–2020 OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2012–2020<br>Software version: 2024.2.3<br>Subject: Autosteer<br>Section: Operating Autosteer - part 1<br>Content: Before you can operate Autosteer, you must enable it by touching Controls > Autopilot > Autopilot Features > Autosteer (Beta). To indicate that Autosteer is available (but not actively steering Model S), the instrument panel displays a gray Autosteer icon. To initiate Autosteer, pull the Autopilot stalk toward you twice in quick succession. NOTE: If the setting for Autopilot Activation is set to Single Pull (touch Controls > Autopilot > Autopilot Activation), Autosteer engages when you pull the Autopilot stalk toward you once. If set to Double Pull, you must pull the Autopilot stalk toward you twice in quick succession to engage Autosteer. To indicate that Autosteer is now actively steering Model S, the instrument panel displays the Autosteer icon in blue. When Autosteer is able to detect lane markings, it also displays the driving lane in blue. Autosteer briefly displays a message on the instrument panel reminding you to pay attention to the road and be ready to take over at any time. The speed at which you can initiate Autosteer can vary depending on various conditions and whether or not a vehicle is detected ahead of you. When no vehicle is detected ahead of you, you must be driving at least 18 mph (30 km/h), unless certain vehicle and environmental conditions are met, in which case, you may be able to initiate it at lower speeds. When a vehicle is detected ahead of you, you can initiate Autosteer at any speed, even when stationary, provided Model S is at least 5 feet (150 cm) behind the detected vehicle. NOTE: When Autosteer is engaged, Auto High Beam is automatically enabled and the maximum cruising speed is 85 mph (140 km/h). WARNING: Never depend on Autopilot features to determine the presence of emergency vehicles. Model S may not detect lights from emergency vehicles. Keep your eyes on your driving path and always be prepared to take immediate action. In situations where Autosteer is temporarily unavailable, the Autosteer icon disappears. For example, your driving speed is not within the speed required for Autosteer to operate. Autosteer may also be unavailable if it is not receiving adequate data from the camera(s). NOTE: In low light conditions (dusk or dark), Autosteer aborts or is unavailable if headlights are set to Off.\n",

If Enable at Start of Every Trip is turned off, touch the Navigate on Autopilot button above the turn-by-turn directions to enable it. Once the Navigate on Autopilot is selected, it will engage whenever you engage Autosteer. The Navigate on Autopilot icon shows in the turn-by-turn direction list when you are navigating to a destination and Navigate on Autopilot is available but not active. If Navigate on Autopilot is active, the icon is blue. If Enable at Start of Every Trip is turned on, the Navigate on Autopilot icon is selected whenever you start navigation. Touch the icon to cancel Navigate on Autopilot and revert to Autosteer. Whenever Navigate on Autopilot is active, the Navigate on Autopilot button is blue and the instrument cluster displays the driving lane as a single blue line in front of Model S: The turn-by-turn directions display the Autosteer icon next to the maneuvers (such as off-ramps) that Navigate on Autopilot will handle. When Navigate on Autopilot is engaged Model S automatically makes both speed-based and route-based lane changes. • Speed Based Lane Changes: Navigate on Autopilot changes lanes to reduce driving time to your destination. For example, if Model S is behind a vehicle going below the set cruising speed, Navigate on Autopilot will move into the passing lane to pass it. Speed-based lanes changes are optional. • Route Based Lane Changes: Navigate on Autopilot changes lanes to route you to your destination. For example, Navigate on Autopilot will move into the exit lane as Model S approaches the off-ramp specified by the navigation route. If you ignore a route-based lane change suggestion (for example, you are driving in the left lane while approaching an off-ramp on the right side of the highway), Navigate on Autopilot is unable to maneuver onto the off-ramp and as a result, you are re-routed to your destination. NOTE: When determining navigation routes, and maneuvers at interchanges, Navigate on Autopilot considers whether or not you want to use High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes.<br><br>Document title: MODEL S 2021 + OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2021 +<br>Software version: 2024.2.3<br>Subject: Driver Profiles<br>Section: G-Meter<br>Content: In Track Mode, a real-time G-Meter displays on the Track Mode pane on the touchscreen. The G-Meter graphically displays peak lateral and longitudinal acceleration values in the form of a circular meter. The history of your drive is represented in the shaded area. The G-Meter resets at the start of each driving session. When you first adjust the driver’s seat, steering yoke (or steering wheel) position, or exterior side mirrors, the touchscreen prompts you to create a driver profile to save these adjustments. Your profile also saves various preferences you make while customizing Model S. To save your profile settings to the cloud and access them across multiple Tesla vehicles, set up a Tesla Profile(see Using Tesla Profiles on page 91).<br>To add a new driver profile, touch the driver profile icon at the top of the touchscreen. Then touch Driver Profile Settings > Add New Driver, type the driver's name and touch Create Profile. Follow the onscreen instructions to save mirror and steering wheel position to the driver profile.<br>Check the Use Easy Entry checkbox if you want to save (or use existing) Easy Entry settings in which the driver's seat and the steering yoke (or steering wheel) are automatically adjusted to make it easy to enter and exit Model S. If you change the position of the driver’s seat, steering yoke (or steering wheel), or exterior side mirrors after you have saved or chosen a driver profile, the touchscreen prompts you to Save the new position or Restore the previously saved position (other settings are automatically saved). To change a setting without saving or restoring, just ignore the prompt. To delete a driver profile, touch the driver profile icon at the top of the touchscreen, touch Driver Profile Settings and select the driver profile you want to remove. Once selected, Delete the driver profile.<br>NOTE: Valet mode is a built-in driver profile that limits speed and restricts access to some Model S features (see Valet Mode on page 92).<br>NOTE: To stop automatic adjustments that are in process based on a driver's profile, touch Stop on the Driver Profile dropdown menu. Automatic adjustments also stop if you manually adjust a seat, mirror, or the steering yoke (or steering wheel).<br><br>Document title: MODEL S 2012–2020 OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2012–2020<br>Software version: 2024.2.3<br>Subject: Navigate on Autopilot<br>Section: Operating Navigate on Autopilot - part 1<br>Content: Once enabled, the Navigate on Autopilot button appears on the map’s turn-by-turn direction list whenever a navigation route is active and the route includes at least one controlled-access highway. When enabled, the Navigate on Autopilot button is blue and the turn-by-turn direction displays the Autosteer icon next to the maneuvers (such as off-ramps) that Navigate on Autopilot will handle. The Navigate on Autopilot icon shows in the turn-by-turn direction list when you are navigating to a destination and Navigate on Autopilot is available but not active. If Navigate on Autopilot is active, the icon is blue. If Enable at Start of Every Trip is turned on, the Navigate on Autopilot icon is selected whenever you start navigation. Touch the icon to cancel Navigate on Autopilot and revert to Autosteer. If Enable At Start Of Every Trip is turned off, you must touch the Navigate on Autopilot button to enable it for each navigation route. Navigate on Autopilot activates and deactivates as appropriate, based on the type of road you are driving on. For example, if Autosteer is active and Navigate on Autopilot is enabled, Navigate on Autopilot automatically becomes active when you reach a controlled-access highway on your navigation route. Whenever Navigate on Autopilot is active, the instrument panel displays the driving lane as a single blue line in front of Model S:<br>When Navigate on Autopilot is active and you approach an off-ramp or interchange along your navigation route, the appropriate turn signal engages and Autosteer maneuvers Model S onto the off-ramp or interchange. WARNING: Never depend on Navigate on Autopilot to determine an appropriate lane at an off-ramp. Stay alert and perform visual checks to ensure that the driving lane is safe and appropriate. When you leave a controlled-access highway (for example, you take an exit or you enter a section of the navigation route that is no longer supported), Navigate on Autopilot reverts to Autosteer— a chime sounds and the instrument panel displays the driving lane lines in blue (instead of the single blue in front of Model S). NOTE: When determining navigation routes, and maneuvers at interchanges, Navigate on Autopilot considers whether or not you want to use High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes.\n",

       "                 Hello! As an assistant to the Tesla customer support team, I'm happy to help answer your questions. When it comes to using Full Self-Driving (FSD) on your Tesla car, there are certain circumstances where it may not be appropriate or safe to use this feature. Here are some examples:<br>1. Weather conditions: FSD is designed to work best in good weather conditions, such as clear skies and dry roads. In heavy rain, snow, or fog, the system may not be able to accurately detect and respond to the environment around the car. It's best to avoid using FSD in extreme weather conditions until the weather improves.<br>2. Road conditions: FSD relies on the car's sensors and cameras to detect and respond to the road environment. If the road is damaged, has potholes, or is otherwise difficult to navigate, the system may not be able to accurately detect and respond to the environment around the car. It's best to avoid using FSD on roads that are not well-maintained or have hazards that could affect the car's safety.<br>3. Traffic conditions: FSD is designed to work best in low-traffic environments, such as residential areas or empty highways. In heavy traffic or congested areas, the system may not be able to accurately detect and respond to the environment around the car. It's best to avoid using FSD in areas with heavy traffic until the traffic conditions improve.<br>4. Construction zones: FSD may not be able to accurately detect and respond to the environment around the car in construction zones, where there may be lane closures, detours, or other hazards. It's best to avoid using FSD in construction zones until the work is completed and the road is safe for driving.<br>5. Pedestrian or cyclist presence: FSD is designed to detect and respond to pedestrians and cyclists, but in areas with heavy pedestrian or cyclist traffic, the system may not be able to accurately detect and respond to all of them. It's best to avoid using FSD in areas with heavy pedestrian or cyclist traffic until the system is improved.<br>6. Road signs and markings: FSD relies on the car's sensors and cameras to detect and respond to road signs and markings\n",

       "                 Under what circumstances should you not use full self-driving on your Tesla car?<br>Several documents provide information on when to avoid using Full Self-Driving (Beta) on a Tesla car. Here are some of the key points:<br>• Interactions with pedestrians, bicyclists, and other road users: Full Self-Driving (Beta) may struggle to detect and respond to these road users, especially in low-light conditions. Therefore, it is recommended to take manual control when approaching intersections or areas with high pedestrian activity.<br>• Unprotected turns with high-speed cross traffic: Full Self-Driving (Beta) may not be able to handle turns with fast-moving cross traffic, so it is essential to take manual control in these situations.<br>• Multi-lane turns: Full Self-Driving (Beta) may struggle to navigate multi-lane turns, so it is recommended to take manual control in these situations.<br>• Simultaneous lane changes: Full Self-Driving (Beta) may not be able to coordinate lane changes with other vehicles, so it is essential to take manual control in these situations.<br>• Narrow roads with oncoming cars or double-parked vehicles: Full Self-Driving (Beta) may struggle to navigate narrow roads with oncoming traffic or double-parked vehicles, so it is recommended to take manual control in these situations.<br>• Rare objects such as trailers, ramps, cargo, open doors, etc. protruding from vehicles: Full Self-Driving (Beta) may not be able to detect and respond to these objects, so it is essential to take manual control in these situations.<br>• Merges onto high-traffic, high-speed roads: Full Self-Driving (Beta) may struggle to handle merges onto high-traffic, high-speed roads, so it is recommended to take manual control in these situations.<br>• Debris in the road: Full Self-Driving (Beta) may not be able to detect and respond to debris in the road, so it is essential to take manual control in these situations.<br>• Construction zones: Full Self-Driving (Beta) may not be able to handle construction zones, so it is recommended to take manual control in these situations.<br><br>Reference documents:<br>Document title: MODEL S 2021 + OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2021 +<br>Software version: 2024.2.3<br>Subject: Limitations and Warnings<br>Section: Autosteer on City Streets (Full Self- Driving (Beta)) - part 1<br>Content: WARNING: Always remember that Full Self-Driving (Beta) (also known as Autosteer on City Streets) does not make Model S autonomous and requires a fully attentive driver who is ready to take immediate action at all times. WARNING: Full Self-Driving (Beta) is a hands-on feature. Keep your hands on the steering yoke (or steering wheel) at all times, be mindful of road conditions and surrounding traffic, and always be prepared to take immediate action. Failure to follow these instructions could cause damage, serious injury or death. It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the limitations of Full Self-Driving (Beta) and the situations in which it may not work as expected. WARNING: Failure to follow all warnings and instructions can result in property damage, serious injury or death. CAUTION: Full Self-Driving (Beta) and its associated functions may not operate as intended and there are numerous situations in which driver intervention may be needed. Examples include (but are not limited to):<br>• Interactions with pedestrians, bicyclists, and other road users. • Unprotected turns with high-speed cross traffic. • Multi-lane turns. • Simultaneous lane changes. • Narrow roads with oncoming cars or double-parked vehicles. • Rare objects such as trailers, ramps, cargo, open doors, etc. protruding from vehicles. • Merges onto high-traffic, high-speed roads. • Debris in the road. • Construction zones. • High curvature roads, particularly at fast driving speeds. Visibility is critical for Full Self-Driving (Beta) to operate. Low visibility, such as low light or poor weather conditions (rain, snow, direct sun, fog, etc.) can significantly degrade performance. WARNING: Model S may quickly and suddenly make unexpected maneuvers or mistakes that require immediate driver intervention. The list above represents only a fraction of the possible scenarios that can cause Full Self-Driving (Beta) to make sudden maneuvers and behave unexpectedly. In fact, Model S can suddenly swerve even when driving conditions appear normal and straight-forward. Stay alert and always pay attention to the roadway so you can anticipate the need to take corrective action as early as possible. Remember that this is an early access feature that must be used with extra caution. CAUTION: As Full Self-Driving (Beta) deployment expands, Tesla will gradually make it available to eligible customers in select countries outside the United States.<br><br>Document title: MODEL S 2021 + OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2021 +<br>Software version: 2024.2.3<br>Subject: Full Self-Driving (Beta)<br>Section: Limitations - part 2<br>Content: Unlike Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Autosteer, and Navigate on Autopilot, which are intended for use on multi-lane roadways with clear lane markings, Full Self-Driving (Beta) is meant to work in a variety of driving scenarios. You can use Full Self-Driving (Beta) on any type of roadway, including residential and city streets. Always remember that Full Self-Driving (Beta) does not make Model S autonomous and requires a fully attentive driver who is ready to take immediate action at all times. While Full Self-Driving (Beta) is engaged, you must monitor your surroundings and other road users at all times. Driver intervention may be required in certain situations, such as on narrow roads with oncoming cars, in construction zones, or while going through complex intersections. For more examples of scenarios in which driver intervention might be required, see Limitations and Warnings on page 125. Full Self-Driving (Beta) uses inputs from cameras mounted at the front, rear, left, and right of Model S to build a model of the area surrounding Model S (see Cameras on page 20). The Full Self-Driving computer installed in Model S is designed to use this input, rapidly process neural networks, and make decisions to safely guide you to your destination. NOTE: Full Self-Driving (Beta) is a beta feature. As Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Beta) capabilities evolve, Model S is upgraded through over-the-air software updates. Download updates as soon as they become available. Like other Autopilot features, Full Self-Driving (Beta) requires a fully attentive driver and will display a series of escalating warnings requiring driver response. You must keep your hands on the steering yoke (or steering wheel) while Full Self-Driving (Beta) is engaged. In addition, the cabin camera monitors driver attentiveness (see Cabin Camera on page 20). Use Full Self-Driving (Beta) in limited Beta only if you will pay constant attention to the road and be prepared to act immediately, especially around blind corners, crossing intersections, and in narrow driving situations. For more information, see Limitations and Warnings on page 125.<br>CAUTION: As Full Self-Driving (Beta) deployment expands, Tesla will gradually make it available to eligible customers in select countries outside of the United States and Canada.<br><br>Document title: MODEL S 2012–2020 OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2012–2020<br>Software version: 2024.2.3<br>Subject: Full Self-Driving (Beta)<br>Section: How to Use Full Self-Driving (Beta)<br>Content: To indicate that Full Self-Driving (Beta) is available but not engaged, the top corner of the touchscreen displays a gray steering wheel icon next to the driving gear. To engage Full-Self Driving (Beta), enter a destination (if desired) and pull the Autopilot stalk toward you twice in quick succession. If you do not enter a destination, Model S chooses the most probable driving path or suggests a destination based on your driving.<br>NOTE: If the setting for Autopilot Activation is set to Single Pull (touch Controls > Autopilot > Autopilot Activation), Autosteer engages when you pull the Autopilot stalk toward you once. While Full Self-Driving (Beta) is engaged:<br>1. The steering wheel icon next to the driving gear is blue and a blue line represents your driving path.<br>2. The instrument panel displays a visualization of the environment surrounding Model S, including the roadway and detected objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, curbs, etc.<br>3. Be ready to take over: There may be occasions where driver intervention is required and you must take over immediately to maintain safe driving. For example, the vehicle may alert you or the visualization may indicate indecisiveness by incessant flickering.<br>NOTE: Practicing a safe disengage before it is necessary is ideal. In addition, like Autosteer, Full Self-Driving (Beta) checks for driver attentiveness and requires your hands on the steering wheel at all times. If your hands are not detected, the instrument panel displays escalating warnings and failure to respond to these warnings cancels Full Self-Driving (Beta) until your next drive.<br>NOTE: Failure to use Full Self-Driving (Beta) appropriately may cause the feature to be disabled.<br>4. Safe disengage: To disengage Full Self-Driving (Beta) safely, be aware of your surroundings and push the Autopilot stalk away from you once, press the brake pedal, or take over and steer manually.<br>When arriving at a chosen destination, Full Self-Driving (Beta) stops Model S and displays a message indicating that navigation is complete.<br>NOTE: Full Self-Driving (Beta) uses Tesla's vision-based system and therefore radar (if equipped) is disabled.<br><br>Document title: MODEL S 2012–2020 OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2012–2020<br>Software version: 2024.2.3<br>Subject: Full Self-Driving (Beta)<br>Section: Limitations - part 1<br>Content: Depending on many different circumstances and environmental conditions, Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control may or may not stop at:<br>• Railroad crossings. • Keep-out zones. • Toll booths. • Crosswalk systems. • Yield signs or temporary traffic lights and stop signs (such as at construction areas). • Miscellaneous traffic U-turn lights, bicycle and pedestrian crossing lights, lane availability lights, etc. In addition, Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is particularly unlikely to operate as intended, can disengage, or may not operate, when one or more of the following conditions are present:<br>• Driving through consecutive light-controlled intersections that are very close to each other. • Visibility is poor (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) or weather conditions are interfering with camera or sensor operation. • Bright light (such as direct sunlight) is interfering with the view of the camera(s). • A camera is obstructed, covered, damaged, or not properly calibrated. • Driving on a hill or on a road that has sharp curves on which the cameras are unable to see upcoming traffic lights or stop signs. • A traffic light, stop sign, or road marking is obstructed (for example, a tree, a large vehicle, etc.). • Model S is being driven very close to a vehicle in front of it, which is blocking the view of a camera. WARNING: The limitations listed above are not an exhaustive list of reasons why Model S may not operate as expected. Many unforeseen circumstances can adversely impact the accurate operation of Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control. Using this feature does not reduce or eliminate the need to drive attentively and responsibly. You must be prepared to take appropriate and immediate action at all times. WARNING: As Full Self-Driving (Beta) deployment expands, Tesla will gradually make it available to eligible customers in select countries outside the United States. Because every country contains unique infrastructure, driving behaviors, and traffic patterns that Full Self-Driving (Beta) must adapt to over time, it is essential for drivers using Full Self-Driving (Beta) in newly eligible countries to be extra attentive and overly cautious. You must be ready to take over safely at any time. Full Self-Driving (Beta) is an early access feature and must be used with additional caution.\n",

WARNING: Failure to follow all warnings and instructions can result in property damage, serious injury or death.<br><br>Document title: MODEL S 2021 + OWNER'S MANUAL<br>Car model: MODEL S 2021 +<br>Software version: 2024.2.3<br>Subject: Limitations and Warnings<br>Section: Autosteer on City Streets (Full Self- Driving (Beta)) - part 1<br>Content: WARNING: Always remember that Full Self-Driving (Beta) (also known as Autosteer on City Streets) does not make Model S autonomous and requires a fully attentive driver who is ready to take immediate action at all times. WARNING: Full Self-Driving (Beta) is a hands-on feature. Keep your hands on the steering yoke (or steering wheel) at all times, be mindful of road conditions and surrounding traffic, and always be prepared to take immediate action. Failure to follow these instructions could cause damage, serious injury or death. It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the limitations of Full Self-Driving (Beta) and the situations in which it may not work as expected. WARNING: Failure to follow all warnings and instructions can result in property damage, serious injury or death. CAUTION: Full Self-Driving (Beta) and its associated functions may not operate as intended and there are numerous situations in which driver intervention may be needed. Examples include (but are not limited to):<br>• Interactions with pedestrians, bicyclists, and other road users. • Unprotected turns with high-speed cross traffic. • Multi-lane turns. • Simultaneous lane changes. • Narrow roads with oncoming cars or double-parked vehicles. • Rare objects such as trailers, ramps, cargo, open doors, etc. protruding from vehicles. • Merges onto high-traffic, high-speed roads. • Debris in the road. • Construction zones. • High curvature roads, particularly at fast driving speeds. Visibility is critical for Full Self-Driving (Beta) to operate. Low visibility, such as low light or poor weather conditions (rain, snow, direct sun, fog, etc.) can significantly degrade performance. WARNING: Model S may quickly and suddenly make unexpected maneuvers or mistakes that require immediate driver intervention. The list above represents only a fraction of the possible scenarios that can cause Full Self-Driving (Beta) to make sudden maneuvers and behave unexpectedly. In fact, Model S can suddenly swerve even when driving conditions appear normal and straight-forward. Stay alert and always pay attention to the roadway so you can anticipate the need to take corrective action as early as possible. Remember that this is an early access feature that must be used with extra caution. CAUTION: As Full Self-Driving (Beta) deployment expands, Tesla will gradually make it available to eligible customers in select countries outside the United States.\n",

      "\"Using autopilot in raining or snowing conditions is generally not recommended. The sensors and cameras on an autonomous vehicle's system may have difficulty detecting and interpreting the road markings and obstacles in wet and slippery conditions, which can lead to errors in navigation and control. Additionally, the vehicle's tires may lose traction and hydroplaning may occur, which can further compromise the vehicle's ability to safely navigate the road. As a result, many autonomous vehicle manufacturers and regulatory agencies advise against using autopilot in rainy or snowy weather, and instead recommend manual driving until the conditions improve.\"\n"

However, it's important to note that Autopilot is a driver-assistance system and not a substitute for human driving.<br>In rainy or snowy conditions, Autopilot may not perform as well as it would in dry conditions. The system relies on sensors and cameras to detect and respond to the environment around the vehicle, and these sensors and cameras can be affected by rain or snow.<br>That being said, Tesla has implemented various safety features to help prevent accidents in inclement weather. For example, Autopilot can detect when the vehicle is in a snowy or icy condition and adjust its speed and steering accordingly. Additionally, Autopilot can detect when the vehicle is in a heavy rain or flooding situation and slow down or stop the vehicle to avoid accidents.<br>However, it's important to use caution when driving in rainy or snowy conditions, even with Autopilot engaged.

      " Yes, it is important to change the oil in your Tesla car regularly to ensure optimal performance and longevity of the vehicle. Unlike traditional gasoline-powered cars, Teslas do not have a traditional oil system and do not require oil changes as frequently. However, it is still important to check and maintain the electric vehicle's (EV) fluids, including the transmission fluid, coolant, and brake fluid. Tesla recommends checking these fluids every 12,000 to 15,000 miles and replacing them as needed. Additionally, it is important to keep the tires properly inflated and to rotate them regularly to ensure even wear and tear. By following these maintenance tips, you can help ensure your Tesla runs smoothly and efficiently for many years to come.\n"

       "                 Hello! As an assistant to the Tesla customer support team, I'm happy to help answer your question.<br>Great question! Tesla electric vehicles (EVs) do not have traditional oil changes like gasoline-powered vehicles. This is because Tesla EVs do not have internal combustion engines that require oil changes. Instead, they have electric motors that are powered by rechargeable batteries.<br>So, you don't need to change oil regularly for your Tesla car. However, it's important to keep your Tesla's battery healthy by following proper charging and maintenance habits. Here are some tips to help you keep your Tesla's battery in top shape:<br>1. Charge your Tesla correctly: Make sure you're charging your Tesla using the recommended charging method for your vehicle. This will help ensure that your battery is charged properly and lasts as long as possible.<br>2. Avoid extreme temperatures: Extreme temperatures can affect your Tesla's battery health. Try to park your Tesla in a shaded area or in a garage when it's hot outside, and avoid leaving it in freezing temperatures for extended periods of time.<br>3. Monitor your Tesla's battery health: You can check your Tesla's battery health using the vehicle's built-in battery monitoring system.

      " No, it's not recommended to wash your Tesla car using regular car washing services. Tesla cars have a special coating on their exteriors that helps to protect the paint and maintain its glossy finish. Regular car washes can scratch or damage this coating, which can lead to fading, oxidation, and other cosmetic issues. Tesla recommends using their own specialized car wash products and techniques to keep your car looking its best. These products are specifically designed to clean and protect the unique materials used in Tesla's vehicles, and they are gentler on the paint and other surfaces than regular car washes. By using the right products and techniques, you can help to maintain your Tesla's showroom appearance and ensure it stays in top condition for years to come.\n"

       "                 Hello! Thank you for reaching out to us. Yes, you can wash your Tesla car using regular car washing services, but there are some precautions to take into consideration to ensure the longevity and performance of your electric vehicle.<br>Firstly, it's important to note that Tesla cars have a special coating on the exterior that helps to reduce drag and improve aerodynamics. This coating can be damaged if exposed to harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaning agents, so it's best to use mild soap and water when washing your car.<br>Additionally, Tesla recommends using a soft, microfiber cloth to clean the car's exterior to avoid scratching the paint or damaging the clear coat. Avoid using abrasive sponges or scrubbers, as they can scratch the paint or damage the protective coating.<br>When it comes to drying your Tesla car, it's important to use a soft, dry microfiber cloth to avoid leaving any water spots or streaks. You can also use a microfiber drying towel to dry the car's exterior, especially in areas where water tends to collect, such as the windows, mirrors, and door handles.<br>Finally, it's important to note that Tesla cars have a special protective coating on the glass surfaces, including the windshield, side windows, and rear window. Avoid using any cleaning products that contain ammonia or alcohol, as they can damage the protective coating and leave streaks or marks on the glass.<br>In summary, while you can wash your Tesla car using regular car washing services, it's important to take some precautions to ensure the longevity and performance of your electric vehicle. Please refer to your owner's manual for more detailed information on how to properly care for your Tesla car.\n",

Treat minor chips and scratches using a paint touch-up pen (available for purchase from Tesla, depending on market region). Use the touch-up pen after washing but before polishing or waxing. Repair rock chips, fractures or scratches.

Wipe gently in a circular motion. Then wipe dry using a soft, lint-free cloth. Although seating surfaces are designed to repel stains, Tesla recommends regular cleaning to maintain performance and an as-new appearance. Promptly treat dye transfer from clothing, such as indigo-dyed denim. Avoid contact with harsh chemicals, including certain cosmetics. Never use cleaners containing alcohol or bleach. Spot-test cleaners on an inconspicuous area before applying to visible surfaces. If equipped with leather seats, note that leather is prone to dye-transfer which can cause discoloration, particularly on light colored leather. White and tan leather is coated with an anti-soiling treatment. Using detergents or commercially available leather cleaners and conditioners is not recommended because they can discolor or dry out the leather. Vacuum seats as needed to remove any loose dirt.<br>CAUTION: Aftermarket, non-Tesla seat covers may inhibit the sensitivity of a seat's occupancy sensors and may cause staining or damage.<br>CAUTION: The front seats are equipped with microphones (see Active Road Noise Reduction on page 12) that must not be exposed to liquids. To prevent damage to these microphones when cleaning, do not over-saturate the area of the seats where these microphones are located. \n",
